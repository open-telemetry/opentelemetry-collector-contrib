The Zookeeper scraper collects metrics from a Zookeeper instance, using the `mntr` command. The `mntr` 4 letter word command needs
to be enabled for the scraper to be able to collect metrics.

## Configuration

- `endpoint`: (default = `localhost:2181`) Endpoint to connect to collect metrics. Takes the form `host:port`. See our [security best practices doc](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/security/config-best-practices/#protect-against-denial-of-service-attacks) to understand how to set the endpoint in different environments.

Example configuration.

## Metrics

Details about the metrics produced by this scraper can be found in [metadata.yaml](./metadata.yaml) with further documentation in [documentation.md](./documentation.md)

## Limitations

This scraper does not support scraping metrics from Zookeeper's [New Metric System](https://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/r3.6.3/zookeeperMonitor.html#Metrics-System).
