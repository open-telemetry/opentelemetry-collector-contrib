  # The probabilistic_sampler sets trace sampling by hashing the trace id of
  # each span and making the sampling decision based on the hashed value. It
  # also implements the "sampling.priority" semantic convention as defined by
  # OpenTracing. See
  # https://github.com/opentracing/specification/blob/master/semantic_conventions.md#span-tags-table
  # The "sampling.priority" semantics have priority over trace id hashing and
  # can be used to control if given spans are sampled, ie.: forwarded, or not.
  probabilistic_sampler:
    # the percentage rate at which traces are going to be sampled. Defaults to
    # zero, i.e.: no sample. Values greater or equal 100 are treated as
    # "sample all traces".
    sampling_percentage: 15.3
    # mode determines the type of sampling logic applied, see the README for details.
    mode: "proportional"

  probabilistic_sampler/logs:
    # the percentage rate at which logs are going to be sampled. Defaults to
    # zero, i.e.: no sample. Values greater or equal 100 are treated as
    # "sample all logs".
    sampling_percentage: 15.3
    # hash_seed allows one to configure the hashing seed. This is important in
    # scenarios where multiple layers of collectors are used to achieve the
    # desired sampling rate, eg.: 10% on first layer and 10% on the
    # second, resulting in an overall sampling rate of 1% (10% x 10%).
    # If all layers use the same seed, all data passing one layer will also pass
    # the next one, independent of the configured sampling rate. Having different
    # seeds at different layers ensures that sampling rate in each layer work as
    # intended.
    #
    # setting the hash_seed != 0 causes hash_seed to be selected by default 
    hash_seed: 22
    # attribute_source defines where to look for the attribute in from_attribute. The allowed values are `traceID` or `record`.
    attribute_source: "record"
    # from_attribute allows to use a log record attribute after the `foo` key
    # to be used to compute the sampling hash of the log record instead of trace id, if trace id is absent or trace id sampling is disabled.
    from_attribute: "foo"
    # sampling_priority allows to use a log record attribute designed by the `bar` key
    # to be used as the sampling priority of the log record.
    sampling_priority: "bar"
