The probabilistic sampler processor supports several modes of sampling
for spans and log records.  Sampling is performed on a per-request
basis, considering individual items statelessly.  For whole trace
sampling, see
[tailsamplingprocessor](../tailsamplingprocessor/README.md).

For trace spans, this sampler supports probabilistic sampling based on
a configured sampling percentage applied to the TraceID.  In addition,
the sampler recognizes a `sampling.priority` annotation, which can
force the sampler to apply 0% or 100% sampling.

For log records, this sampler can be configured to use the embedded
TraceID and follow the same logic as applied to spans.  When the
TraceID is not defined, the sampler can be configured to apply hashing
to a selected log record attribute.  This sampler also supports
sampling priority.

## Consistency guarantee

A consistent probability sampler is a Sampler that supports
independent sampling decisions for each span or log record in a group
(e.g. by TraceID), while maximizing the potential for completeness as
follows.

Consistent probability sampling requires that for any span in a given
trace, if a Sampler with lesser sampling probability selects the span
for sampling, then the span would also be selected by a Sampler
configured with greater sampling probability.

## Completeness property

A trace is complete when all of its members are sampled.  A
"sub-trace" is complete when all of its descendents are sampled.

Ordinarily, Trace and Logging SDKs configure parent-based samplers
which decide to sample based on the Context, because it leads to
completeness.

When non-root spans or logs make independent sampling decisions
instead of using the parent-based approach (e.g., using the
`TraceIDRatioBased` sampler for a non-root span), incompleteness may
result, and when spans and log records are independently sampled in a
processor, as by this component, the same potential for completeness
arises.  The consistency guarantee helps minimize this issue.

Consistent probability samplers can be safely used with a mixture of
probabilities and preserve sub-trace completeness, provided that child
spans and log records are sampled with probability greater than or
equal to the parent context.

Using 1%, 10% and 50% probabilities for example, in a consistent
probability scheme the 50% sampler must sample when the 10% sampler
does, and the 10% sampler must sample when the 1% sampler does.  A
three-tier system could be configured with 1% sampling in the first
tier, 10% sampling in the second tier, and 50% sampling in the bottom
tier.  In this configuration, 1% of traces will be complete, 10% of
traces will be sub-trace complete at the second tier, and 50% of
traces will be sub-trace complete at the third tier thanks to the
consistency property.

These guidelines should be considered when deploying multiple
collectors with different sampling probabilities in a system.  For
example, a collector serving frontend servers can be configured with
smaller sampling probability than a collector serving backend servers,
without breaking sub-trace completeness.

## Sampling randomness

To achieve consistency, sampling randomness is taken from a
deterministic aspect of the input data.  For traces pipelines, the
source of randomness is always the TraceID.  For logs pipelines, the
source of randomness can be the TraceID or another log record
attribute, if configured.

For log records, the `attribute_source` and `from_attribute` fields determine the
source of randomness used for log records.  When `attribute_source` is
set to `traceID`, the TraceID will be used.  When `attribute_source`
is set to `record` or the TraceID field is absent, the value of
`from_attribute` is taken as the source of randomness (if configured).

## Sampling priority

The sampling priority mechanism is an override, which takes precedence
over the probabilistic decision in all modes.

🛑 Compatibility note: Logs and Traces have different behavior.

In traces pipelines, when the priority attribute has value 0, the
configured probability will by modified to 0% and the item will not
pass the sampler.  When the priority attribute is non-zero the
configured probability will be set to 100%.  The sampling priority
attribute is not configurable, and is called `sampling.priority`.

In logs pipelines, when the priority attribute has value 0, the
configured probability will by modified to 0%, and the item will not
pass the sampler. Otherwise, the logs sampling priority attribute is
interpreted as a percentage, with values >= 100 equal to 100%
sampling. The logs sampling priority attribute is configured via
`sampling_priority`. If the logs sampling priority attribute is not
set on a log record, the default sampling percentage applies.

## Mode Selection

There are three sampling modes available.  All modes are consistent.

### Hash seed

The hash seed method uses the FNV hash function applied to either a
Trace ID (spans, log records), or to the value of a specified
attribute (only logs).  The hashed value, presumed to be random, is
compared against a threshold value that corresponds with the sampling
percentage.

This mode is selected by default. The seed value will be 0 if the
`hash_seed` is not configured.

In order for hashing to be consistent, all collectors for a given tier
(e.g. behind the same load balancer) must have the same
`hash_seed`. It is also possible to leverage a different `hash_seed`
at different collector tiers to support additional sampling
requirements.

This mode uses 14 bits of information in its sampling decision; the
default `sampling_precision`, which is 4 hexadecimal digits, exactly
encodes this information.

#### Hash seed: Use-cases

The hash seed mode is most useful in logs sampling, because it can be
applied to units of telemetry other than TraceID.  For example, a
deployment consisting of 100 pods can be sampled according to the
`service.instance.id` resource attribute.  In this case, 10% sampling
implies collecting log records from an expected value of 10 pods.

### Proportional

OpenTelemetry specifies a consistent sampling mechanism using 56 bits
of randomness, which may be obtained from the Trace ID according to
the W3C Trace Context Level 2 specification.  Randomness can also be
explicitly encoding in the OpenTelemetry `tracestate` field, where it is
known as the R-value.

This mode is named because it reduces the number of items transmitted
proportionally, according to the sampling probability.  In this mode,
items are selected for sampling without considering how much they were
already sampled by preceding samplers.

This mode uses 56 bits of information in its calculations.  The
default `sampling_precision` (4) will cause thresholds to be rounded
in some cases when they contain more than 16 significant bits.

#### Proportional: Use-cases

The proportional mode is generally applicable in trace sampling,
because it is based on OpenTelemetry and W3C specifications.  This
mode is selected by default, because it enforces a predictable
(probabilistic) ratio between incoming items and outgoing items of
telemetry.  No matter how SDKs and other sources of telemetry have
been configured with respect to sampling, a collector configured with
25% proportional sampling will output (an expected value of) 1 item
for every 4 items input.

### Equalizing

This mode uses the same randomness mechanism as the proportional
sampling mode, in this case considering how much each item was already
sampled by preceding samplers.  This mode can be used to lower
sampling probability to a minimum value across a whole pipeline, 
making it possible to conditionally adjust sampling probabilities.

This mode compares a 56 bit threshold against the configured sampling
probability and updates when the threshold is larger.  The default
`sampling_precision` (4) will cause updated thresholds to be rounded
in some cases when they contain more than 16 significant bits.

#### Equalizing: Use-cases

The equalizing mode is useful in collector deployments where client
SDKs have mixed sampling configuration and the user wants to apply a
uniform sampling probability across the system.  For example, a user's
system consists of mostly components developed in-house, but also some
third-party software.  Seeking to lower the overall cost of tracing,
the configures 10% sampling in the samplers for all of their in-house
components.  This leaves third-party software components unsampled,
making the savings less than desired.  In this case, the user could
configure a 10% equalizing probabilistic sampler.  Already-sampled
items of telemetry from the in-house components will pass-through one
for one in this scenario, while items of telemetry from third-party
software will be sampled by the intended amount.

## Sampling threshold information

In all modes, information about the effective sampling probability is
added into the item of telemetry.  The random variable that was used
may also be recorded, in case it was not derived from the TraceID
using a standard algorithm.

For traces, threshold and optional randomness information are encoded
in the W3C Trace Context `tracestate` fields.  The tracestate is
divided into sections according to a two-character vendor code;
OpenTelemetry uses "ot" as its section designator.  Within the
OpenTelemetry section, the sampling threshold is encoded using "th"
and the optional random variable is encoded using "rv".

For example, 25% sampling is encoded in a tracing Span as:

```
tracestate: ot=th:c
```

Users can randomness values in this way, independently, making it
possible to apply consistent sampling across traces for example.  If
the Trace was initialized with pre-determined randomness value
`9b8233f7e3a151` and 100% sampling, it would read:

```
tracestate: ot=th:0;rv:9b8233f7e3a151
```

This component, using either proportional or equalizing modes, could
apply 50% sampling the Span.  This span with randomness value
`9b8233f7e3a151` is consistently sampled at 50% because the threshold,
when zero padded (i.e., `80000000000000`), is less than the randomness
value.  The resulting span will have the following tracestate:

```
tracestate: ot=th:8;rv:9b8233f7e3a151
```

For log records, threshold and randomness information are encoded in
the log record itself, using attributes.  For example, 25% sampling
with an explicit randomness value is encoded as:

```
sampling.threshold: c
sampling.randomness: e05a99c8df8d32
```

### Sampling precision

When encoding sampling probability in the form of a threshold,
variable precision is permitted making it possible for the user to
restrict sampling probabilities to rounded numbers of fixed width.

Because the threshold is encoded using hexadecimal digits, each digit
contributes 4 bits of information.  One digit of sampling precision
can express exact sampling probabilities 1/16, 2/16, ... through
16/16.  Two digits of sampling precision can express exact sampling
probabilities 1/256, 2/256, ... through 256/256.  With N digits of
sampling precision, there are exactly `(2^N)-1` exactly representable
probabilities.

Depending on the mode, there are different maximum reasonable settings
for this parameter.

- The `hash_seed` mode uses a 14-bit hash function, therefore
  precision 4 completely captures the available information.
- The `equalizing` mode configures a sampling probability after
  parsing a `float32` value, which contains 20 bits of precision,
  therefore precision 5 completely captures the available information.
- The `proportional` mode configures its ratio using a `float32`
  value, however it carries out the arithmetic using 56-bits of
  precision.  In this mode, increasing precision has the effect
  of preserving precision applied by preceding samplers.

In cases where larger precision is configured than is actually
available, the added precision has no effect because trailing zeros
are eliminated by the encoding.

### Error handling

This processor considers it an error when the arriving data has no
randomness.  This includes conditions where the TraceID field is
invalid (16 zero bytes) and where the log record attribute source has
zero bytes of information.

By default, when there are errors determining sampling-related
information from an item of telemetry, the data will be refused.  This
behavior can be changed by setting the `fail_closed` property to
false, in which case erroneous data will pass through the processor.

## Configuration

The following configuration options can be modified:

- `mode` (string, optional): One of "proportional", "equalizing", or "hash_seed"; the default is "hash_seed".
- `sampling_percentage` (32-bit floating point, required): Percentage at which items are sampled; >= 100 samples all items, 0 rejects all items.
- `hash_seed` (32-bit unsigned integer, optional, default = 0): An integer used to compute the hash algorithm. Note that all collectors for a given tier (e.g. behind the same load balancer) should have the same hash_seed.
- `fail_closed` (boolean, optional, default = true): Whether to reject items with sampling-related errors.
- `sampling_precision` (integer, optional, default = 4): Determines the number of hexadecimal digits used to encode the sampling threshold.  Permitted values are 1..14.

### Logs-specific configuration

- `attribute_source` (string, optional, default = "traceID"): defines where to look for the attribute in from_attribute. The allowed values are `traceID` or `record`.
- `from_attribute` (string, optional, default = ""): The name of a log record attribute used for sampling purposes, such as a unique log record ID. The value of the attribute is only used if the trace ID is absent or if `attribute_source` is set to `record`.
- `sampling_priority` (string, optional, default = ""): The name of a log record attribute used to set a different sampling priority from the `sampling_percentage` setting. The record attribute value's should be between 0 and 100, while 0 means to never sample the log record, and >= 100 means to always sample the log record.

Examples:

Sample 15% of log records according to trace ID using the OpenTelemetry
specification.

```yaml
processors:
  probabilistic_sampler:
    sampling_percentage: 15
```

Sample logs according to their logID attribute:

```yaml
processors:
  probabilistic_sampler:
    sampling_percentage: 15
    attribute_source: record # possible values: one of record or traceID
    from_attribute: logID # value is required if the source is not traceID
```

Give sampling priority to log records according to the attribute named
`priority`:

```yaml
processors:
  probabilistic_sampler:
    sampling_percentage: 15
    sampling_priority: priority
```
