## Description

The metrics generation processor (`metricsgenerationprocessor`) can be used to create new metrics using existing metrics following a given rule. This processor currently supports the following two rule types for creating a new metric.

1. `calculate`: It can create a new metric from two existing metrics by applying one of the following arithmetic operations: add, subtract, multiply, divide, or percent. One use case is to calculate the `pod.memory.utilization` metric like the following equation-
`pod.memory.utilization` = (`pod.memory.usage.bytes` / `node.memory.limit`)
1. `scale`: It can create a new metric by scaling the value of an existing metric with a given constant number. One use case is to convert `pod.memory.usage` metric values from Megabytes to Bytes (multiply the existing metric's value by 1,048,576)

## `calculate` Rule Functionality

There are some specific behaviors of the `calculate` metric generation rule that users may want to be aware of:

- The created metric will have the same type as the metric configured as `metric1`.
- If no valid data points are calculated for the metric being created, it will not be created.
  This ensures the processor is not emitting new metrics that are empty.
- Users may want to have metric calculations done on data points whose overlapping attributes match. To enable this
  behavior, please enable the feature gate `metricsgeneration.MatchAttributes`. This feature gate is disabled
  by default, meaning the value used for `metric2` during the calculations is simply the first data point's value.
  Refer to [documentation](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/main/featuregate/README.md)
  for more information on how to enable and disable feature gates.

## Configuration

Configuration is specified through a list of generation rules. Generation rules find the metrics which 
match the given metric names and apply the specified operation to those metrics.

```yaml
processors:
    # processor name: metricsgeneration
    metricsgeneration:

        # specify the metric generation rules
        rules:
              # Name of the new metric. This is a required field.
            - name: <new_metric_name>

              # Unit for the new metric being generated.
              unit: <new_metric_unit>

              # type describes how the new metric will be generated. It can be one of `calculate` or `scale`.  calculate generates a metric applying the given operation on two operand metrics. scale operates only on operand1 metric to generate the new metric.
              type: {calculate, scale}

              # This is a required field. This must be a gauge or sum metric.
              metric1: <first_operand_metric>

              # This field is required only if the type is "calculate". When required, this must be a gauge or sum metric.
              metric2: <second_operand_metric>

              # Operation specifies which arithmetic operation to apply. It must be one of the five supported operations.
              operation: {add, subtract, multiply, divide, percent}
```

## Example Configurations

### Create a new metric using two existing metrics
```yaml
# create pod.cpu.utilized following (pod.cpu.usage / node.cpu.limit)
rules:
    - name: pod.cpu.utilized
      type: calculate
      metric1: pod.cpu.usage
      metric2: node.cpu.limit
      operation: divide
```

### Create a new metric scaling the value of an existing metric
```yaml
# create pod.memory.usage.bytes from pod.memory.usage.megabytes
rules:
    - name: pod.memory.usage.bytes
      unit: Bytes
      type: scale
      metric1: pod.memory.usage.megabytes
      operation: multiply
      scale_by: 1048576
```
