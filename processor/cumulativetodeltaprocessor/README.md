## Description

The cumulative to delta processor (`cumulativetodeltaprocessor`) converts monotonic, cumulative sum and histogram metrics to monotonic, delta metrics. Non-monotonic sums and exponential histograms are excluded.

## Configuration

Configuration is specified through a list of metrics. The processor uses metric names to identify a set of cumulative metrics and converts them from cumulative to delta.

The following settings can be optionally configured:

- `include`: List of metrics names or patterns to convert to delta.
- `exclude`: List of metrics names or patterns to not convert to delta.  **If a metric name matches both include and exclude, exclude takes precedence.**
- `max_staleness`: The total time a state entry will live past the time it was last seen. Set to 0 to retain state indefinitely. Default: 0

If neither include nor exclude are supplied, no filtering is applied.

#### Examples

```yaml
processors:
    # processor name: cumulativetodelta
    cumulativetodelta:

        # list the exact cumulative sum or histogram metrics to convert to delta
        include:
            metrics:
                - <metric_1_name>
                - <metric_2_name>
                .
                .
                - <metric_n_name>
            match_type: strict
```

```yaml
processors:
    # processor name: cumulativetodelta
    cumulativetodelta:

        # Convert cumulative sum or histogram metrics to delta
        # if and only if 'metric' is in the name
        include:
            metrics:
                - "*metric*"
            match_type: regexp
```

```yaml
processors:
    # processor name: cumulativetodelta
    cumulativetodelta:

        # Convert cumulative sum or histogram metrics to delta
        # if and only if 'metric' is not in the name
        exclude:
            metrics:
                - "*metric*"
            match_type: regexp
```

```yaml
processors:
    # processor name: cumulativetodelta
    cumulativetodelta:
        # If include/exclude are not specified
        # convert all cumulative sum or histogram metrics to delta
```

## Warnings

- [Statefulness](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/main/docs/standard-warnings.md#statefulness): The cumulativetodelta processor's calculates delta by remembering the previous value of a metric.  For this reason, the calculation is only accurate if the metric is continuously sent to the same instance of the collector.  As a result, the cumulativetodelta processor may not work as expected if used in a deployment of multiple collectors.  When using this processor it is best for the data source to being sending data to a single collector.
