## Description

The metrics transform processor can be used to rename metrics, and add, rename
or delete label keys and values. It can also be used to perform scaling and
aggregations on metrics across labels or label values. The complete list of
supported operations that can be applied to one or more metrics is provided in
the below table.

:information_source: This processor only supports renames/aggregations **within
a batch of metrics**. It does not do any aggregation across batches, so it is
not suitable for aggregating metrics from multiple sources (e.g. multiple nodes
or clients).

| Operation                     | Example (based on metric `system.cpu.usage`)                                                    |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Rename metrics                | Rename to `system.cpu.usage_time`                                                               |
| Add labels                    | Add new label `identifier` with value `1` to all points                                         |
| Rename label keys             | Rename label `state` to `cpu_state`                                                             |
| Rename label values           | For label `state`, rename value `idle` to `-`                                                   |
| Delete data points            | Delete all points where label `state` has value `idle`                                          |
| Toggle data type              | Change from `int` data points to `double` data points                                           |
| Scale value                   | Multiply values by 1000 to convert from seconds to milliseconds                                 |
| Aggregate across label sets   | Retain only the label `state`, average all points with the same value for this label            |
| Aggregate across label values | For label `state`, sum points where the value is `user` or `system` into `used = user + system` |

In addition to the above:

- Operations can be applied to one or more metrics using a `strict` or `regexp`
  filter
- The `action` property allows metrics to be:
  - Updated in-place (`update`)
  - Copied and updates applied to the copy (`insert`)
  - Combined into a newly inserted metric that is generated by combining all data
    points from the set of matching metrics into a single metric (`combine`); the
    original matching metrics are also removed
- When renaming metrics, capturing groups from the `regexp` filter will be
  expanded
- When adding or updating a label value, `{{version}}` will be replaced with
  this collector's version number

## Configuration

Configuration is specified through a list of transformations and operations.
Transformations and operations will be applied to all metrics in order so that
later transformations or operations may reference the result of previous
transformations or operations.

```yaml
processors:
  metricstransform:
  # transforms is a list of transformations with each element transforming a metric selected by metric name
    transforms:
    
        # SPECIFY WHICH METRIC(S) TO MATCH
        
        # include specifies the metric name used to determine which metric(s) to operate on
      - include: <metric_name>
        # match_type specifies whether the include name should be used as a strict match or regexp match, default = strict
        match_type: {strict, regexp}
    
        # experimental_match_labels specifies the label set against which the metric filter will work. If experimental_match_labels is specified, transforms will only be applied to those metrics which 
        # have the provided metric label values. This works for both strict and regexp match_type. This is an experimental feature.
        experimental_match_labels: {<label1>: <label_value1>, <label2>: <label_value2>}
        
        # SPECIFY THE ACTION TO TAKE ON THE MATCHED METRIC(S)
        
        # action specifies if the operations (specified below) are performed on metrics in place (update), on an inserted clone (insert), or on a new combined metric (combine)
        action: {update, insert, combine}
        
        # SPECIFY HOW TO TRANSFORM THE METRIC GENERATED AS A RESULT OF APPLYING THE ABOVE ACTION
        
        # new_name specifies the updated name of the metric; if action is insert or combine, new_name is required
        new_name: <new_metric_name_inserted>
        # aggregation_type defines how combined data points will be aggregated; if action is combine, aggregation_type is required
        aggregation_type: {sum, mean, min, max, count, median}
        # submatch_case specifies the case that should be used when adding label values based on regexp submatches when performing a combine action; leave blank to use the submatch value as is
        submatch_case: {lower, upper}
        # operations contain a list of operations that will be performed on the resulting metric(s)
        operations:
            # action defines the type of operation that will be performed, see examples below for more details
          - action: {add_label, update_label, delete_label_value, toggle_scalar_data_type, experimental_scale_value, aggregate_labels, aggregate_label_values}
            # label specifies the label to operate on
            label: <label>
            # new_label specifies the updated name of the label; if action is add_label, new_label is required
            new_label: <new_label>
            # aggregated_values contains a list of label values that will be aggregated; if action is aggregate_label_values, aggregated_values is required
            aggregated_values: [values...]
            # new_value specifies the updated name of the label value; if action is add_label or aggregate_label_values, new_value is required
            new_value: <new_value>
            # label_value specifies the label value for which points should be deleted; if action is delete_label_value, label_value is required
            label_value: <label_value>
            # label_set contains a list of labels that will remain after aggregation; if action is aggregate_labels, label_set is required
            label_set: [labels...]
            # aggregation_type defines how data points will be aggregated; if action is aggregate_labels or aggregate_label_values, aggregation_type is required
            aggregation_type: {sum, mean, min, max, count, median}
            # experimental_scale specifies the scalar to apply to values
            experimental_scale: <scalar>
            # value_actions contain a list of operations that will be performed on the selected label
            value_actions:
                # value specifies the value to operate on
              - value: <current_label_value>
                # new_value specifies the updated value
                new_value: <new_label_value>
```

    aggregation_type: sum
```

**NOTE:** Only the `sum` aggregation function is supported for histogram and exponential histogram datatypes.

### Combine metrics
```yaml
# convert a set of metrics for each http_method into a single metric with an http_method label, i.e.
#
# Web Service (*)/Total Delete Requests     iis.requests{http_method=delete}
# Web Service (*)/Total Get Requests     >  iis.requests{http_method=get}
# Web Service (*)/Total Post Requests       iis.requests{http_method=post}
include: ^Web Service \(\*\)/Total (?P<http_method>.*) Requests$
match_type: regexp
action: combine
new_name: iis.requests
submatch_case: lower
operations:
  ...
```

### Group Metrics 
```yaml
# Group metrics from one single ResourceMetrics and report them as multiple ResourceMetrics.
# 
# ex: Consider pod and container metrics collected from Kubernetes. Both the metrics are recorded under under one ResourceMetric
# applying this transformation will result in two separate ResourceMetric packets with corresponding resource labels in the resource headers
#
# instead of regular $ use double dollar $$. Because $ is treated as a special character.


- include: ^k8s\.pod\.(.*)$$
  match_type: regexp
  action: group
  group_resource_labels: {"resouce.type": "k8s.pod", "source": "kubelet"}
- include: ^container\.(.*)$$
  match_type: regexp
  action: group
  group_resource_labels: {"resouce.type": "container", "source": "kubelet"}
```

### Metric Transform Processor vs. [Attributes Processor for Metrics](../attributesprocessor)

Regarding metric support, these two processors have overlapping functionality. They can both do simple modifications
of metric attribute key-value pairs. As a general rule the attributes processor has more attribute related
functionality, while the metrics transform processor can do much more data manipulation. The attributes processor
is preferred when the only needed functionality is overlapping, as it natively uses the official OpenTelemetry
data model. However, if the metric transform processor is already in use or its extra functionality is necessary,
there's no need to migrate away from it.

Shared functionality
* Add attributes
* Update values of attributes

Attribute processor specific functionality
* delete
* hash
* extract

Metric transform processor specific functionality
* Rename metrics
* Delete data points
* Toggle data type
* Scale value
* Aggregate across label sets
* Aggregate across label values
