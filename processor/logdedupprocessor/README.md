This processor is used to deduplicate logs by detecting identical logs over a range of time and emitting a single log with the count of logs that were deduplicated.

## How It Works
1. The user configures the log deduplication processor in the desired logs pipeline.
2. If the processor does not provide `conditions`, all logs are considered eligible for aggregation. If the processor does have configured `conditions`, all log entries where at least one of the `conditions` evaluates `true` are considered eligible for aggregation. Eligible identical logs are aggregated over the configured `interval`. Logs are considered identical if they have the same body, resource attributes, severity, and log attributes. Logs that do not match any condition in `conditions` are passed onward in the pipeline without aggregating.
3. After the interval, the processor emits a single log with the count of logs that were deduplicated. The emitted log will have the same body, resource attributes, severity, and log attributes as the original log. The emitted log will also have the following new attributes:

    - `log_count`: The count of logs that were deduplicated over the interval. The name of the attribute is configurable via the `log_count_attribute` parameter.
    - `first_observed_timestamp`: The timestamp of the first log that was observed during the aggregation interval.
    - `last_observed_timestamp`: The timestamp of the last log that was observed during the aggregation interval.

**Note**: The `ObservedTimestamp` and `Timestamp` of the emitted log will be the time that the aggregated log was emitted and will not be the same as the `ObservedTimestamp` and `Timestamp` of the original logs.

### Example Config
The following config is an example configuration for the log deduplication processor. It is configured with an aggregation interval of `60 seconds`, a timezone of `America/Los_Angeles`, and a log count attribute of `dedup_count`. It has no fields being excluded.
```yaml
receivers:
    filelog:
        include: [./example/*.log]
processors:
    logdedup:
        interval: 60s
        log_count_attribute: dedup_count
        timezone: 'America/Los_Angeles'
exporters:
    googlecloud:

service:
    pipelines:
        logs:
            receivers: [filelog]
            processors: [logdedup]
            exporters: [googlecloud]
```

### Example Config with Excluded Fields
The following config is an example configuration that excludes the following fields from being considered when searching for duplicate logs:

- `timestamp` field from the body
- `host.name` field from attributes
- `ip` nested attribute inside a map attribute named `src`

```yaml
receivers:
    filelog:
        include: [./example/*.log]
processors:
    logdedup:
        exclude_fields:
          - body.timestamp
          - attributes.host\.name
          - attributes.src.ip
exporters:
    googlecloud:

service:
    pipelines:
        logs:
            receivers: [filelog]
            processors: [logdedup]
            exporters: [googlecloud]
```


### Example Config with Conditions
The following config is an example configuration that only performs the deduping process on telemetry where Attribute `ID` equals `1` OR where Resource Attribute `service.name` equals `my-service`:

```yaml
receivers:
    filelog:
        include: [./example/*.log]
processors:
    logdedup:
        conditions:
            - attributes["ID"] == 1
            - resource.attributes["service.name"] == "my-service"
        interval: 60s
        log_count_attribute: dedup_count
        timezone: 'America/Los_Angeles'
exporters:
    googlecloud:

service:
    pipelines:
        logs:
            receivers: [filelog]
            processors: [logdedup]
            exporters: [googlecloud]
```
