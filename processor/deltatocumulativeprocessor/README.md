## Description

The delta to cumulative processor (`deltatocumulativeprocessor`) converts
metrics from delta temporality to cumulative, by accumulating samples in memory.

## Configuration

``` yaml
processors:
    deltatocumulative:
        # how long until a series not receiving new samples is removed
        [ max_stale: <duration> | default = 5m ]
 
        # upper limit of streams to track. new streams exceeding this limit
        # will be dropped
        [ max_streams: <int> | default = 0 (off) ]

```

There is no further configuration required. All delta samples are converted to cumulative.

## Troubleshooting

When [Telemetry is
enabled](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/configuration/#telemetry), this component exports [several metrics](./documentation.md).
