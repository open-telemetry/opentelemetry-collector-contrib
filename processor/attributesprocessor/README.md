The attributes processor modifies attributes of a span, log, or metric. Please refer to
[config.go](./config.go) for the config spec.

This processor also supports the ability to filter and match input data to determine
if they should be [included or excluded](#includeexclude-filtering) for specified actions.

It takes a list of actions which are performed in order specified in the config.
The supported actions are:
- `insert`: Inserts a new attribute in input data where the key does not already exist.
- `update`: Updates an attribute in input data where the key does exist.
- `upsert`: Performs insert or update. Inserts a new attribute in input data where the
  key does not already exist and updates an attribute in input data where the key
  does exist.
- `delete`: Deletes an attribute from the input data.
- `hash`: Hashes (SHA1) an existing attribute value.
- `extract`: Extracts values using a regular expression rule from the input key
  to target keys specified in the rule. If a target key already exists, it will
  be overridden. Note: It behaves similar to the Span Processor `to_attributes`
  setting with the existing attribute as the source.
- `convert`: Converts an existing attribute to a specified type.

For the actions `insert`, `update` and `upsert`,
 - `key`  is required
 - one of `value`, `from_attribute` or `from_context` is required
 - `action` is required.
```yaml
  # Key specifies the attribute to act upon.
- key: <key>
  action: {insert, update, upsert}
  # Value specifies the value to populate for the key.
  # The type is inferred from the configuration.
  value: <value>

  # Key specifies the attribute to act upon.
- key: <key>
  action: {insert, update, upsert}
  # FromAttribute specifies the attribute from the input data to use to populate
  # the value. If the attribute doesn't exist, no action is performed.
  from_attribute: <other key>

  # Key specifies the attribute to act upon.
- key: <key>
  action: {insert, update, upsert}
  # FromContext specifies the context value to use to populate the attribute value. 
  # If the key is prefixed with `metadata.`, the values are searched
  # in the receiver's transport protocol additional information like gRPC Metadata or HTTP Headers
  # (be sure to set `include_metadata: true` on the receiver).
  # If the key is prefixed with `auth.`, the values are searched
  # in the authentication information set by the server authenticator.
  # Refer to the server authenticator's documentation part of your pipeline for more information about which attributes are available.
  # If the key is `client.address`, the value will be set to the client address. 
  # If the key doesn't exist, no action is performed.
  # If the key has multiple values the values will be joined with `;` separator.
  from_context: <other key>
```

For the `delete` action,
 - `key` and/or `pattern` is required
 - `action: delete` is required.
```yaml
# Key specifies the attribute to act upon.
- key: <key>
  action: delete
  # Rule specifies the regex pattern for attribute names to act upon.
  pattern: <regular pattern>
```


For the `hash` action,
 - `key` and/or `pattern` is required
 - `action: hash` is required.
```yaml
# Key specifies the attribute to act upon.
- key: <key>
  action: hash
  # Rule specifies the regex pattern for attribute names to act upon.
  pattern: <regular pattern>
```


For the `extract` action,
 - `key` is required
 - `pattern` is required.
 ```yaml
 # Key specifies the attribute to extract values from.
 # The value of `key` is NOT altered.
- key: <key>
  # Rule specifies the regex pattern used to extract attributes from the value
  # of `key`.
  # The submatchers must be named.
  # If attributes already exist, they will be overwritten.
  pattern: <regular pattern with named matchers>
  action: extract

 ```


For the `convert` action,
 - `key` is required
 - `action: convert` is required.
 - `converted_type` is required and must be one of int, double or string
```yaml
# Key specifies the attribute to act upon.
- key: <key>
  action: convert
  converted_type: <int|double|string>
```

The list of actions can be composed to create rich scenarios, such as
back filling attribute, copying values to a new key, redacting sensitive information.
The following is a sample configuration.

```yaml
processors:
  attributes/example:
    actions:
      - key: db.table
        action: delete
      - key: redacted_span
        value: true
        action: upsert
      - key: copy_key
        from_attribute: key_original
        action: update
      - key: account_id
        value: 2245
        action: insert
      - key: account_password
        action: delete
      - key: account_email
        action: hash
      - key: http.status_code
        action: convert
        converted_type: int

```

Refer to [config.yaml](./testdata/config.yaml) for detailed
examples on using the processor.

### Attributes Processor for Metrics vs. [Metric Transform Processor](../metricstransformprocessor)

Regarding metric support, these two processors have overlapping functionality. They can both do simple modifications
of metric attribute key-value pairs. As a general rule the attributes processor has more attribute related
functionality, while the metrics transform processor can do much more data manipulation. The attributes processor
is preferred when the only needed functionality is overlapping, as it natively uses the official OpenTelemetry
data model. However, if the metric transform processor is already in use or its extra functionality is necessary,
there's no need to migrate away from it.

Shared functionality
* Add attributes
* Update values of attributes

Attribute processor specific functionality
* delete
* hash
* extract

Metric transform processor specific functionality
* Rename metrics
* Delete data points
* Toggle data type
* Scale value
* Aggregate across label sets
* Aggregate across label values

## Include/Exclude Filtering

The [attribute processor](README.md) exposes an option to provide a set of properties of a span, log 
or metric record to match against to determine if the input data should be included or excluded from
the processor. To configure this option, under `include` and/or `exclude` at least `match_type` and 
one of the following is required:
- For spans, one of `services`, `span_names`, `span_kinds`, `attributes`, `resources` or `libraries` 
must be specified with a non-empty value for a valid configuration. The `log_bodies`, `log_severity_texts`, 
`log_severity_number` and `metric_names` fields are invalid.
- For logs, one of `log_bodies`, `log_severity_texts`, `log_severity_number`, `attributes`, `resources`
or `libraries` must be specified with a non-empty value for a valid configuration. The `span_names`, 
`span_kinds`, `metric_names` and `services` fields are invalid.
- For metrics, one of `metric_names` or `resources` must be specified with a valid non-empty value for
a valid configuration. The `span_names`, `span_kinds`, `log_bodies`, `log_severity_texts`,
`log_severity_number`, `services`, `attributes` and `libraries` fields are invalid.


Note: If both `include` and `exclude` are specified, the `include` properties
are checked before the `exclude` properties.

```yaml
attributes:
    # include and/or exclude can be specified. However, the include properties
    # are always checked before the exclude properties.
    {include, exclude}:
      # At least one of services, span_names or attributes must be specified.
      # It is supported to have more than one specified, but all of the specified
      # conditions must evaluate to true for a match to occur.

      # match_type controls how items in "services", "span_names", and "attributes"
      # arrays are interpreted. Possible values are "regexp" or "strict".
      # This is a required field.
      match_type: {strict, regexp}

      # regexp is an optional configuration section for match_type regexp.
      regexp:
        # < see "Match Configuration" below >

      # services specify an array of items to match the service name against.
      # A match occurs if the span service name matches at least one of the items.
      # This is an optional field.
      services: [<item1>, ..., <itemN>]

      # resources specifies a list of resources to match against.
      # A match occurs if the input data resources matches at least one of the items.
      # This is an optional field.
      resources:
          # Key specifies the resource to match against.
        - key: <key>
          # Value specifies the exact value to match against.
          # If not specified, a match occurs if the key is present in the resources.
          value: {value}

      # libraries specify a list of items to match the implementation library against.
      # A match occurs if the input data implementation library matches at least one of the items.
      # This is an optional field.
      libraries: [<item1>, ..., <itemN>]
          # Name specifies the library to match against.
        - name: <name>
          # Version specifies the exact version to match against.
          # This is an optional field.
          # If the field is not set, any version will match.
          # If the field is set to an empty string, only an
          # empty string version will match.
          version: {version}

      # The span name must match at least one of the items.
      # This is an optional field.
      span_names: [<item1>, ..., <itemN>]

      # The span kind must match at least one of the items.
      # This is an optional field.
      span_kinds: [<item1>, ..., <itemN>]

      # The log body must match at least one of the items.
      # Currently only string body types are supported.
      # This is an optional field.
      log_bodies: [<item1>, ..., <itemN>]

      # The log severity text must match at least one of the items.
      # This is an optional field.
      log_severity_texts: [<item1>, ..., <itemN>]

      # The log severity number defines how to match against a log record's
      # SeverityNumber, if defined.
      # This is an optional field.
      log_severity_number:
        # Min is the lowest severity that may be matched.
        # e.g. if this is plog.SeverityNumberInfo, 
        # INFO, WARN, ERROR, and FATAL logs will match.
        min: <int>
        # MatchUndefined controls whether logs with "undefined" severity matches.
        # If this is true, entries with undefined severity will match.
        match_undefined: <bool>

      # The metric name must match at least one of the items.
      # This is an optional field.
      metric_names: [<item1>, ..., <itemN>]

      # Attributes specifies the list of attributes to match against.
      # All of these attributes must match for a match to occur.
      # This is an optional field.
      attributes:
          # Key specifies the attribute to match against.
        - key: <key>
          # Value specifies the value to match against.
          # If not specified, a match occurs if the key is present in the attributes.
          value: {value}
```

### Match Configuration

Some `match_type` values have additional configuration options that can be
specified. The `match_type` value is the name of the configuration section.
These sections are optional.

```yaml
# regexp is an optional configuration section for match_type regexp.
regexp:
  # cacheenabled determines whether match results are LRU cached to make subsequent matches faster.
  # Cache size is unlimited unless cachemaxnumentries is also specified.
  cacheenabled: <bool>
  # cachemaxnumentries is the max number of entries of the LRU cache; ignored if cacheenabled is false.
  cachemaxnumentries: <int>
```

## Warnings

In general, the Attributes processor is a very safe processor to use.  Care only needs to be taken when modifying data point attributes:
- [Identity Conflict](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/main/docs/standard-warnings.md#identity-conflict): Reducing/changing existing data point attributes has the potential to create an identity conflict since the Attributes processor does not perform any re-aggregation of the data points. Adding new attributes to data points is safe.
