description: Config specifies the set of attributes to be inserted, updated, upserted and deleted and the properties to include/exclude a span from being processed. This processor handles all forms of modifications to attributes within a span, log, or metric. Prior to any actions being applied, each span is compared against the include properties and then the exclude properties if they are specified. This determines if a span is to be processed or not. The list of actions is applied in order specified in the configuration.
