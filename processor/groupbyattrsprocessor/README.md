## Description

This processor re-associates spans, log records and metric datapoints to a *Resource* that matches with the specified attributes. As a result, all spans, log records or metric datapoints with the same values for the specified attributes are "grouped" under the same *Resource*.

Typical use cases:

* extract resources from "flat" data formats, such as Fluentbit logs or Prometheus metrics
* associate Prometheus metrics to a *Resource* that describes the relevant host, based on label present on all metrics
* optimize data packaging by extracting common attributes
* [compacting](#compaction) multiple records that share the same Resource and InstrumentationLibrary attributes but are under multiple ResourceSpans/ResourceMetrics/ResourceLogs, into a single ResourceSpans/ResourceMetrics/ResourceLogs (when empty list of keys is being provided). This might happen e.g. when [groupbytrace](../groupbytraceprocessor) processor is being used or data comes in multiple requests. By compacting data, it takes less memory, is more efficiently processed, serialized and the number of export requests is reduced.

It is recommended to use the `groupbyattrs` processor together with [batch](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/tree/main/processor/batchprocessor) processor, as a consecutive step, as this will reduce the fragmentation of data (by grouping records together under matching Resource/Instrumentation Library)

## Examples

### Grouping metrics

Consider the below metrics, all originally associated to the same *Resource*:

```go
Resource {host.name="localhost",source="prom"}
  Metric "gauge-1" (GAUGE)
    DataPoint {host.name="host-A",id="eth0"}
    DataPoint {host.name="host-A",id="eth0"}
    DataPoint {host.name="host-B",id="eth0"}
  Metric "gauge-1" (GAUGE) // Identical to previous Metric
    DataPoint {host.name="host-A",id="eth0"}
    DataPoint {host.name="host-A",id="eth0"}
    DataPoint {host.name="host-B",id="eth0"}
  Metric "mixed-type" (GAUGE)
    DataPoint {host.name="host-A",id="eth0"}
    DataPoint {host.name="host-A",id="eth0"}
    DataPoint {host.name="host-B",id="eth0"}
  Metric "mixed-type" (SUM)
    DataPoint {host.name="host-A",id="eth0"}
    DataPoint {host.name="host-A",id="eth0"}
  Metric "dont-move" (Gauge)
    DataPoint {id="eth0"}
```

With the below configuration, the **groupbyattrs** will re-associate the metrics with either `host-A` or `host-B`, based on the value of the `host.name` attribute.

```yaml
processors:
  groupbyattrs:
    keys:
      - host.name
```

The output of the processor will therefore be:

```go
Resource {host.name="localhost",source="prom"}
  Metric "dont-move" (Gauge)
    DataPoint {id="eth0"}

Resource {host.name="host-A",source="prom"}
  Metric "gauge-1"
    DataPoint {id="eth0"}
    DataPoint {id="eth0"}
    DataPoint {id="eth0"}
    DataPoint {id="eth0"}
  Metric "mixed-type" (GAUGE)
    DataPoint {id="eth0"}
    DataPoint {id="eth0"}
  Metric "mixed-type" (SUM)
    DataPoint {id="eth0"}
    DataPoint {id="eth0"}

Resource {host.name="host-B",source="prom"}
  Metric "gauge-1"
    DataPoint {id="eth0"}
    DataPoint {id="eth0"}
  Metric "mixed-type" (GAUGE)
    DataPoint {id="eth0"}
```

Notes:

* The *DataPoints* for the `gauge-1` (GAUGE) metric were originally split under 2 *Metric* instances and have been merged in the output
* The *DataPoints* of the `mixed-type` (GAUGE) and `mixed-type` (SUM) metrics have not been merged under the same *Metric*, because their *DataType* is different
* The `dont-move` metric *DataPoints* don't have a `host.name` attribute and therefore remained under the original *Resource*
* The new *Resources* inherited the attributes from the original *Resource* (`source="prom"`), **plus** the specified attributes from the processed metrics (`host.name="host-A"` or `host.name="host-B"`)
* The specified "grouping" attributes that are set on the new *Resources* are also **removed** from the metric *DataPoints*
* While not shown in the above example, the processor also merges collections of records under matching InstrumentationLibrary

### Compaction

In some cases, the data might come in single requests to the collector or become fragmented due to use of [groupbytrace](../groupbytraceprocessor) processor. Even after batching there might be multiple duplicated ResourceSpans/ResourceLogs/ResourceMetrics objects, which leads to additional memory consumption, increased processing costs, inefficient serialization and increase of the export requests. As a remedy, `groupbyattrs` processor might be used to compact the data with matching Resource and InstrumentationLibrary properties.

For example, consider the following input:

```go
Resource {host.name="localhost"}
  InstrumentationLibrary {name="MyLibrary"}
  Spans
    Span {span_id=1, ...}
  InstrumentationLibrary {name="OtherLibrary"}
  Spans
    Span {span_id=2, ...}
    
Resource {host.name="localhost"}
  InstrumentationLibrary {name="MyLibrary"}
  Spans
    Span {span_id=3, ...}
    
Resource {host.name="localhost"}
  InstrumentationLibrary {name="MyLibrary"}
  Spans
    Span {span_id=4, ...}
    
Resource {host.name="otherhost"}
  InstrumentationLibrary {name="MyLibrary"}
  Spans
    Span {span_id=5, ...}
```

With the below configuration, the **groupbyattrs** will re-associate the spans with matching Resource and InstrumentationLibrary. 

```yaml
processors:
  batch:
  groupbyattrs:

pipelines:
  traces:
    processors: [batch, groupbyattrs/grouping]
    ...
```

The output of the processor will therefore be:

```go
Resource {host.name="localhost"}
  InstrumentationLibrary {name="MyLibrary"}
  Spans
    Span {span_id=1, ...}
    Span {span_id=3, ...}
    Span {span_id=4, ...}
  InstrumentationLibrary {name="OtherLibrary"}
  Spans
    Span {span_id=2, ...}

Resource {host.name="otherhost"}
  InstrumentationLibrary {name="MyLibrary"}
  Spans
    Span {span_id=5, ...}
```

## Configuration

The configuration is very simple, as you only need to specify an array of attribute keys that will be used to "group" spans, log records or metric data points together, as in the below example:

```yaml
processors:
  groupbyattrs:
    keys:
      - foo
      - bar
```

The `keys` property describes which attribute keys will be considered for grouping:

* If the processed span, log record and metric data point has at least one of the specified attributes key, it will be moved to a *Resource* with the same value for these attributes. The *Resource* will be created if none exists with the same attributes.
* If none of the specified attributes key is present in the processed span, log record or metric data point, it remains associated to the same *Resource* (no change), with multiple instances of the same *Resource* still [compacted](#compaction).

Please refer to:

* [config.go](./config.go) for the config spec
* [config.yaml](./testdata/config.yaml) for detailed examples on using the processor
