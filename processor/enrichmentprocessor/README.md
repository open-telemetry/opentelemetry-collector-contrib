The enrichment processor adds attributes to telemetry by looking up external metadata. It supports enriching:
- Resource attributes (context: "resource")
- Individual span/log/metric data point attributes (context: "individual")

Metadata can be provided via:
- File
- HTTP

Both HTTP and file sources are periodically refreshed.

Accepted data format for metadata is CSV/JSON.

CSV requires a header row and each row should contain same number of value.
JSON should be simple list of key value pair like below: 

```json
[
	{
	  "service_name": "user-service",
	  "owner_team": "platform-team",
	  "environment": "production",
	  "region": "us-east-1"
	},
	{
	  "service_name": "payment-service",
	  "owner_team": "payments-team",
	  "environment": "production",
	  "region": "us-west-2"
	}
]
```

## Configuration

```yaml
processors:
  enrichment:
    data_sources:
      - name: service_inventory
        type: http
        http:
          url: https://example.com/api/services
          headers: { }
          timeout: 30s
          refresh_interval: 5m
      - name: host_metadata
        type: file
        file:
          path: /etc/collector/hosts.csv
          format: csv  # json|csv
          refresh_interval: 1m
    enrichment_rules:
      # Enrich resource attributes using host metadata
      - name: enrich_resource_from_host
        context: resource
        data_source: host_metadata
        lookup_attributekey: host.name            # attribute in telemetry
        lookup_field: hostname           # field in data source
        mappings:
          - source_field: region
            target_attribute: cloud.region
          - source_field: environment
            target_attribute: deployment.environment
      # Enrich spans/logs/metrics with service metadata
      - name: enrich_individual_from_service
        context: individual
        data_source: service_inventory
        lookup_attributekey: service.name
        lookup_field: service_name
        mappings:
          - source_field: owner_team
            target_attribute: team.name
          - source_field: environment
            target_attribute: deployment.environment
```

## Configuration options

- processors.enrichment
  - data_sources: List of external sources to read enrichment data from.
    - name: Unique identifier for this source. Required.
    - type: "http" or "file". Required.
    - http: Required when type=http.
      - url: Endpoint returning an array of JSON objects. Required.
      - headers: Optional map of request headers.
      - timeout: Request timeout (e.g., 30s, 1m). Optional.
      - refresh_interval: How often to refetch data (e.g., 5m). Required for periodic refresh.
      - json_path: Optional; currently not used. The response must already be an array of objects.
    - file: Required when type=file.
      - path: Path to the file. Required.
      - format: "json" or "csv". Required.
      - refresh_interval: How often to reload the file (e.g., 1m). Required for periodic refresh.
  - enrichment_rules: List of rules describing how to map source fields to attributes.
    - name: Unique rule name. Required.
    - context: Where to apply the rule. One of "resource" or "individual". Required.
    - data_source: Name of a configured data source to query. Required.
    - lookup_attributekey: Attribute in telemetry used as the lookup key (e.g., service.name). Required.
    - lookup_field: Field name in the data source to match against (e.g., service_name). Required.
    - mappings: List of field mappings to apply. At least one required.
      - source_field: Field name in the data source row. Required.
      - target_attribute: Attribute to set on the telemetry. Required.

Behavior:
- If multiple rows share the same lookup_field value, the last one loaded wins.
- Empty values in the source row are skipped (no attribute is set).
- Each source is refreshed on its refresh_interval.
- Rule errors are logged; processing continues with other rules.

## Using in a pipeline

```yaml
service:
  pipelines:
    traces:
      processors: [enrichment]
    metrics:
      processors: [enrichment]
    logs:
      processors: [enrichment]
```

## Notes
- Context must be one of: resource, individual.
- HTTP and file sources are periodically refreshed using refresh_interval.
- JSON files/endpoints must return an array of objects; CSV requires a header row.
- When multiple rows share the same lookup_field value, the last one read wins.
