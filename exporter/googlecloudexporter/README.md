This exporter can be used to send metrics to [Google Cloud Monitoring](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring)
(formerly Stackdriver), traces to [Google Cloud Trace](https://cloud.google.com/trace),
and logs to [Google Cloud Logging](https://cloud.google.com/logging).

## Getting started

### Prerequisite: Authenticating

In general, authenticating with the Collector exporter follows the same steps as
any other app using the steps documented for [Application Default
Credentials](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/provide-credentials-adc). This
section explains the specific use cases relevant to the exporter.

The exporter relies on GCP client libraries to send data to Google Cloud. Use of these libraries requires the caller (the Collector) to be authenticated with a GCP account and project. This should be done using a [GCP service account](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/access/service-accounts) with at minimum the following IAM roles (depending on the type of data you wish to send):

*   [Metrics](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-roles#monitoring-roles): `roles/monitoring.metricWriter`
*   [Traces](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-roles#cloud-trace-roles): `roles/cloudtrace.agent`
*   [Logs](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-roles#logging-roles): `roles/logging.logWriter`

The [Compute Engine default service account](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/access/service-accounts#default_service_account) has all of these permissions by default, but if you are running on a different platform or with a different GCP service account you will need to ensure your service account has these permissions.

#### Options for different environments

Depending on the environment where your Collector is running, you can authenticate one of several ways:

**GCE instances**

On GCE it is recommended to use the [GCP service account](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/access/service-accounts) associated with your instance. If this is the Compute Engine default service account or another GCP service account with the sufficient IAM permissions, then there is nothing additional you need to do to authenticate the Collector process. Simply run the Collector on your instance, and it will inherit these permissions.

**GKE / Workload Identity**

On GKE clusters with Workload Identity enabled (including GKE Autopilot), follow [the steps to configure a Workload Identity ServiceAccount in your cluster](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/workload-identity) (if you do not already have one). Then, deploy the Collector as you would with any other workload, setting the `serviceAccountName` field in the Collector Pod’s `.spec` to the WI-enabled ServiceAccount.

In non-WI clusters, you can use the GCP service account associated with the node the same way as in the instructions for GCE instances above.

**Non-GCP (AWS, Azure, on-prem, etc.) or alternative service accounts**

In non-GCP environments, a [service account key](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/keys-create-delete#iam-service-account-keys-create-console) or credentials file is required. The exporter will automatically look for this file using the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable or, if that is unset, one of the [other known locations](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/application-default-credentials). Note that when using this approach, you may need to explicitly set the `project` option in the exporter’s config.

When running the Collector in a Docker container, a credentials file can be passed to the container via volume mounts and environment variables at runtime like so:

```
docker run \
  --volume ~/service-account-key.json:/etc/otel/key.json \
  --volume $(pwd)/config.yaml:/etc/otel/config.yaml \
  --env GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/etc/otel/key.json \
  --expose 4317 \
  --expose 55681 \
  --rm \
  otel/opentelemetry-collector-contrib
```

**Using `gcloud auth application-default login`**

Using [`gcloud auth application-default login`](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/application-default-credentials) to authenticate is not recommended for production use. Instead, it’s best to use a GCP service account through one of the methods listed above. The `gcloud auth` command can be useful for development and testing on a user account, and authenticating with it follows the same approach as the service account key method above.


These instructions are to get you up and running quickly with the GCP exporter in a local development environment. We'll also point out alternatives that may be more suitable for CI or production.

1.  **Obtain a Collector binary.** Pull a binary or Docker image for the
    OpenTelemetry contrib collector which includes the GCP exporter plugin
    through one of the following:

    *   Download a [binary or package of the OpenTelemetry
        Collector Contrib](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-releases/releases)
        that is appropriate for your platform, and includes the Google Cloud
        exporter.
    *   Pull a Docker image with `docker pull otel/opentelemetry-collector-contrib`
    *   Create your own main package in Go, that pulls in just the plugins you need.
    *   Use the [OpenTelemetry Collector
        Builder](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-builder)
        to generate the Go main package and `go.mod`.

2.  **Create a configuration file `config.yaml`.** The example below shows a minimal recommended configuration that receives OTLP and sends data to GCP, in addition to verbose logging to help understand what is going on. It uses application default credentials (which we will set up in the next step).

    Note that this configuration includes the recommended `memory_limiter` and `batch` plugins, which avoid high latency for reporting telemetry, and ensure that the collector itself will stay stable (not run out of memory) by dropping telemetry if needed.

    ```yaml
    receivers:
      otlp:
        protocols:
          grpc:
          http:
    exporters:
      googlecloud:
        log:
          default_log_name: opentelemetry.io/collector-exported-log
    processors:
      memory_limiter:
        check_interval: 1s
        limit_percentage: 65
        spike_limit_percentage: 20
      batch:
      resourcedetection:
        detectors: [gcp]
        timeout: 10s
    service:
      pipelines:
        traces:
          receivers: [otlp]
          processors: [memory_limiter, batch]
          exporters: [googlecloud]
        metrics:
          receivers: [otlp]
          processors: [memory_limiter, batch]
          exporters: [googlecloud]
        logs:
          receivers: [otlp]
          processors: [memory_limiter, batch]
          exporters: [googlecloud]
    ```

3.  **Set up credentials.**

    1.  Enable billing in your GCP project.

    2.  Enable the Cloud Metrics and Cloud Trace APIs.

    3.  Ensure that your user GCP user has (at minimum) `roles/monitoring.metricWriter` and `roles/cloudtrace.agent`. You can learn about [metric-related](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/access-control) and [trace-related](https://cloud.google.com/trace/docs/iam) IAM in the GCP documentation.

    4.  Obtain credentials using one of the methods in the [Authenticating
        section](#prerequisite-authenticating) above.


4.  **Run the collector.** The following  runs the collector in the foreground, so please execute it in a separate terminal.

    ```sh
    ./otelcol-contrib --config=config.yaml
    ```

    <details>
    <summary>Alternatives</summary>

    If you obtained OS-specific packages or built your own binary in step 1, you'll need to follow the appropriate conventions for running the collector.

    </details>

5.  **Gather telemetry.** Run an application that can submit OTLP-formatted metrics and traces, and configure it to send them to `127.0.0.1:4317` (for gRPC) or `127.0.0.1:55681` (for HTTP).

    <details>
      <summary>Alternatives</summary>

      *   Set up the host metrics receiver, which will gather telemetry from the host without needing an external application to submit telemetry.

      *   Set up an application-specific receiver, such as the Nginx receiver, and run the corresponding application.

      *   Set up a receiver for some other protocol (such Prometheus, StatsD, Zipkin or Jaeger), and run an application that speaks one of those protocols.
    </details>

6.  **View telemetry in GCP.** Use the GCP [metrics explorer](https://console.cloud.google.com/monitoring/metrics-explorer) and [trace overview](https://console.cloud.google.com/traces) to view your newly submitted telemetry.

## Configuration reference

The following configuration options are supported:

- `project` (default = Fetch from Credentials): GCP project identifier.
- `destination_project_quota` (optional): Counts quota for traces and metrics against the project to which the data is sent (as opposed to the project associated with the Collector's service account. For example, when setting `project_id` or using [multi-project export](#multi-project-exporting). (default = false)
- `user_agent` (default = `opentelemetry-collector-contrib {{version}}`): Override the user agent string sent on requests to Cloud Monitoring (currently only applies to metrics). Specify `{{version}}` to include the application version number.
- `impersonate` (optional): Configuration for service account impersonation
  - `target_principal`: TargetPrincipal is the email address of the service account to impersonate.
  - `subject`: (optional) Subject is the sub field of a JWT. This field should only be set if you wish to impersonate as a user. This feature is useful when using domain wide delegation.
  - `delegates`: (default = []) Delegates are the service account email addresses in a delegation chain. Each service account must be granted roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreatoron the next service account in the chain.
- `metric` (optional): Configuration for sending metrics to Cloud Monitoring.
  - `prefix` (default = `workload.googleapis.com`): The prefix to add to metrics.
  - `endpoint` (default = monitoring.googleapis.com): Endpoint where metric data is going to be sent to.
  - `use_insecure` (default = false): If true, use gRPC as their communication transport. Only has effect if Endpoint is not "".
  - `known_domains` (default = [googleapis.com, kubernetes.io, istio.io, knative.dev]): If a metric belongs to one of these domains it does not get a prefix.
  - `skip_create_descriptor` (default = false): If set to true, do not send metric descriptors to GCM.
  - `instrumentation_library_labels` (default = true): If true, set the instrumentation_source and instrumentation_version labels.
  - `create_service_timeseries` (default = false): If true, this will send all timeseries using `CreateServiceTimeSeries`. Implicitly, this sets `skip_create_descriptor` to true.
  - `create_metric_descriptor_buffer_size` (default = 10): Buffer size for the channel which asynchronously calls CreateMetricDescriptor.
  - `service_resource_labels` (default = true):  If true, the exporter will copy OTel's service.name, service.namespace, and service.instance.id resource attributes into the GCM timeseries metric labels.
  - `resource_filters` (default = []): If provided, resource attributes matching any filter will be included in metric labels. Can be defined by `prefix`, `regex`, or `prefix` AND `regex`.
    - `prefix`: Match resource keys by prefix.
    - `regex`: Match resource keys by regex.
  - `cumulative_normalization` (default = true): If true, normalizes cumulative metrics without start times or with explicit reset points by subtracting subsequent points from the initial point. It is enabled by default. Since it caches starting points, it may result inincreased memory usage.
  - `sum_of_squared_deviation` (default = false): If true, enables calculation of an estimated sum of squared deviation.  It is an estimate, and is not exact.
  - `compression` (optional): Enable gzip compression for gRPC requests (valid vlaues: `gzip`).
  - `experimental_wal` (default = []): If provided, enables use of a write ahead
    log for time series requests.
    - `directory` (default = `./`): Path to local directory for WAL file.
    - `max_backoff` (default = `1h`): Max duration to retry requests on network
      errors (`UNAVAILABLE` or `DEADLINE_EXCEEDED`).
- `trace` (optional): Configuration for sending traces to Cloud Trace.
  - `endpoint` (default = cloudtrace.googleapis.com): Endpoint where trace data is going to be sent to.
  - `use_insecure` (default = false): If true. use gRPC as their communication transport. Only has effect if Endpoint is not "". Replaces `use_insecure`.
  - `attribute_mappings` (optional): AttributeMappings determines how to map from OpenTelemetry attribute keys to Google Cloud Trace keys.  By default, it changes http and service keys so that they appear more prominently in the UI.
    - `key`: Key is the OpenTelemetry attribute key
    - `replacement`: Replacement is the attribute sent to Google Cloud Trace
- `log` (optional): Configuration for sending metrics to Cloud Logging.
  - `endpoint` (default = logging.googleapis.com): Endpoint where log data is going to be sent to. D
  - `use_insecure` (default = false): If true, use gRPC as their communication transport. Only has effect if Endpoint is not "".
  - `default_log_name` (optional): Defines a default name for log entries. If left unset, and a log entry does not have the `gcp.log_name` attribute set, the exporter will return an error processing that entry.
  - `resource_filters` (default = []): If provided, resource attributes matching any filter will be included in log labels. Can be defined by `prefix`, `regex`, or `prefix` AND `regex`.
    - `prefix`: Match resource keys by prefix.
    - `regex`: Match resource keys by regex.
  - `compression` (optional): Enable gzip compression for gRPC requests (valid vlaues: `gzip`).
- `retry_on_failure` (optional): Configuration for how to handle retries when sending data to Google Cloud fails.
  - `enabled` (default = false)
  - `initial_interval` (default = 5s): Time to wait after the first failure before retrying; ignored if `enabled` is `false`
  - `max_interval` (default = 30s): Is the upper bound on backoff; ignored if `enabled` is `false`
  - `max_elapsed_time` (default = 120s): Is the maximum amount of time spent trying to send a batch; ignored if `enabled` is `false`
- `sending_queue` (optional): Configuration for how to buffer traces before sending.
  - `enabled` (default = true)
  - `num_consumers` (default = 10): Number of consumers that dequeue batches; ignored if `enabled` is `false`
  - `queue_size` (default = 1000): Maximum number of batches kept in memory before data; ignored if `enabled` is `false`;
    User should calculate this as `num_seconds * requests_per_second` where:
    - `num_seconds` is the number of seconds to buffer in case of a backend outage
    - `requests_per_second` is the average number of requests per seconds.

Note: These `retry_on_failure` and `sending_queue` are provided (and documented) by the [Exporter Helper](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/tree/main/exporter/exporterhelper#configuration)

Beyond standard YAML configuration as outlined in the sections that follow,
exporters that leverage the net/http package (all do today) also respect the
following proxy environment variables:

* HTTP_PROXY
* HTTPS_PROXY
* NO_PROXY

If set at Collector start time then exporters, regardless of protocol,
will or will not proxy traffic as defined by these environment variables.

### Logging Example

The logging exporter processes OpenTelemetry log entries and exports them to GCP Cloud Logging. Logs can be collected using one 
of the opentelemetry-collector-contrib log receivers, such as the [filelogreceiver](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/filelogreceiver).

Log entries must contain any Cloud Logging-specific fields as a matching OpenTelemetry attribute (as shown in examples from the
[logs data model](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/logs/data-model.md#google-cloud-logging)).
These attributes can be parsed using the various [log operators](../../pkg/stanza/docs/operators/README.md#what-operators-are-available) available upstream.

For example, the following config parses the [HTTPRequest field](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/reference/v2/rest/v2/LogEntry#HttpRequest) from Apache log entries saved in `/var/log/apache.log`. 
It also parses out the `timestamp` and inserts a non-default `log_name` attribute and GCP [MonitoredResource](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/reference/v2/rest/v2/MonitoredResource) attribute.

```yaml
receivers:
  filelog:
    include: [ /var/log/apache.log ]
    start_at: beginning
    operators:
      - id: http_request_parser
        type: regex_parser
        regex: '(?m)^(?P<remoteIp>[^ ]*) (?P<host>[^ ]*) (?P<user>[^ ]*) \[(?P<time>[^\]]*)\] "(?P<requestMethod>\S+)(?: +(?P<requestUrl>[^\"]*?)(?: +(?P<protocol>\S+))?)?" (?P<status>[^ ]*) (?P<responseSize>[^ ]*)(?: "(?P<referer>[^\"]*)" "(?P<userAgent>[^\"]*)")?$'
        parse_to: attributes["gcp.http_request"]
        timestamp:
          parse_from: attributes["gcp.http_request"].time
          layout_type: strptime
          layout: '%d/%b/%Y:%H:%M:%S %z'
    converter:
      max_flush_count: 100
      flush_interval: 100ms

exporters:
  googlecloud:
    project: my-gcp-project
    log:
      default_log_name: opentelemetry.io/collector-exported-log

processors:
  memory_limiter:
    check_interval: 1s
    limit_percentage: 65
    spike_limit_percentage: 20
  resourcedetection:
    detectors: [gcp]
    timeout: 10s
  attributes:
    # Override the default log name.  `gcp.log_name` takes precedence
    # over the `default_log_name` specified in the exporter.
    actions:
      - key: gcp.log_name
        action: insert
        value: apache-access-log

service:
    logs:
      receivers: [filelog]
      processors: [memory_limiter, resourcedetection, attributes]
      exporters: [googlecloud]

```

This would parse logs of the following example structure:

```
127.0.0.1 - - [26/Apr/2022:22:53:36 +0800] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 1247
```

To the following GCP entry structure:

```
        {
          "logName": "projects/my-gcp-project/logs/apache-access-log",
          "resource": {
            "type": "gce_instance",
            "labels": {
              "instance_id": "",
              "zone": ""
            }
          },
          "textPayload": "127.0.0.1 - - [26/Apr/2022:22:53:36 +0800] \"GET / HTTP/1.1\" 200 1247",
          "timestamp": "2022-05-02T12:16:14.574548493Z",
          "httpRequest": {
            "requestMethod": "GET",
            "requestUrl": "/",
            "status": 200,
            "responseSize": "1247",
            "remoteIp": "127.0.0.1",
            "protocol": "HTTP/1.1"
          }
        }
```

The logging exporter also supports the full range of [GCP log severity levels](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/reference/v2/rpc/google.logging.type#google.logging.type.LogSeverity), 
which differ from the available [OpenTelemetry log severity levels](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/logs/data-model.md#severity-fields). 
To accommodate this, the following mapping is used to equate an incoming OpenTelemetry [`SeverityNumber`](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/logs/data-model.md#field-severitynumber) 
to a matching GCP log severity:

|OTel `SeverityNumber`/Name|GCP severity level|
|---|---|
|Undefined|Default|
|1-4 / Trace|Debug|
|5-8 / Debug|Debug|
|9-10 / Info|Info|
|11-12 / Info|Notice|
|13-16 / Warn|Warning|
|17-20 / Error|Error|
|21-22 / Fatal|Critical|
|23 / Fatal|Alert|
|24 / Fatal|Emergency|

The upstream [severity parser](../../pkg/stanza/docs/types/severity.md) (along
with the [regex parser](../../pkg/stanza/docs/operators/regex_parser.md)) allows for
additional flexibility in parsing log severity from incoming entries.

## Multi-Project exporting

By default, the exporter sends telemetry to the project specified by `project` in the configuration. This can be overridden on a per-metrics basis using the `gcp.project.id` resource attribute. For example, if a metric has a label `project`, you could use the `groupbyattrs` processor to promote it to a resource label, and the `resource` processor to rename the attribute from `project` to `gcp.project.id`.

### Multi-Project quota usage

The `gcp.project.id` label can be combined with the `destination_project_quota` option to attribute quota usage to the project parsed by the label. This feature is currently only available
for traces and metrics. The Collector's default service account will need `roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageConsumer` IAM permissions in the destination quota project.

Note that this option will not work  if a quota project is already defined in your Collector's GCP credentials. In this case, the telemetry will fail to export with a "project not found" error.
This can be done by manually editing your [ADC file](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/application-default-credentials#personal) (if it exists) to remove the `quota_project_id` entry line.

## Features and Feature-Gates

See the [Collector feature gates](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/main/featuregate/README.md#collector-feature-gates) for an overview of feature gates in the collector.
