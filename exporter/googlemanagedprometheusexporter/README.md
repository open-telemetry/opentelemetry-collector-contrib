This exporter can be used to send metrics (including trace exemplars) to [Google Cloud Managed Service for Prometheus](https://cloud.google.com/stackdriver/docs/managed-prometheus). It is one of [several supported approaches for sending metrics to Google Cloud Managed Service for Prometheus](https://cloud.google.com/stackdriver/docs/managed-prometheus#gmp-data-collection).

## Configuration Reference

The following configuration options are supported:

- `project` (optional): GCP project identifier.
- `user_agent` (optional): Override the user agent string sent on requests to Cloud Monitoring (currently only applies to metrics). Specify `{{version}}` to include the application version number. Defaults to `opentelemetry-collector-contrib {{version}}`.
- `metric`(optional): Configuration for sending metrics to Cloud Monitoring.
  - `endpoint` (optional): Endpoint where metric data is going to be sent to. Replaces `endpoint`.
  - `compression` (optional): Compression format for Metrics gRPC requests. Supported values: [`gzip`].  Defaults to no compression.
  - `grpc_pool_size` (optional): Sets the size of the connection pool in the GCP client. Defaults to a single connection.
  - `use_insecure` (optional): If true, disables gRPC client transport security. Only has applies if Endpoint is not "".
  - `add_metric_suffixes` (default=`true`): Add type and unit suffixes to metrics.
  - `extra_metrics_config` (optional): Enable or disable additional metrics.
    - `enable_target_info` (default=`true`): Add `target_info` metric based on resource.
    - `enable_scope_info` (default=`true`): Add `otel_scope_info` metric and `scope_name`/`scope_version` attributes to all other metrics.
  - `resource_filters` (optional): Provides a list of filters to match resource attributes which will be included in metric labels.
    - `prefix` (optional): Match resource attribute keys by prefix.
    - `regex` (optional): Match resource attribute keys by regex.
- `sending_queue` (optional): Configuration for how to buffer traces before sending.
  - `enabled` (default = true)
  - `num_consumers` (default = 10): Number of consumers that dequeue batches; ignored if `enabled` is `false`
  - `queue_size` (default = 1000): Maximum number of batches kept in memory before data; ignored if `enabled` is `false`;
    User should calculate this as `num_seconds * requests_per_second` where:
    - `num_seconds` is the number of seconds to buffer in case of a backend outage
    - `requests_per_second` is the average number of requests per seconds.

Note: The `sending_queue` is provided (and documented) by the [Exporter Helper](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/tree/main/exporter/exporterhelper#configuration)

## Resource Attribute Handling

The Google Managed Prometheus exporter maps metrics to the
[prometheus_target](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/resources#tag_prometheus_target)
monitored resource. The logic for mapping to monitored resources is designed to
be used with the prometheus receiver, but can be used with other receivers as
well. To avoid collisions (i.e. "duplicate timeseries enountered" errors), you
need to ensure the prometheus_target resource uniquely identifies the source of
metrics. The exporter uses the following resource attributes to determine
monitored resource:

* location: [`location`, `cloud.availability_zone`, `cloud.region`]
* cluster: [`cluster`, `k8s.cluster.name`]
* namespace: [`namespace`, `k8s.namespace.name`]
* job: [`service.name` + `service.namespace`]
* instance: [`service.instance.id`]

In the configuration above, `cloud.availability_zone`, `cloud.region`, and
`k8s.cluster.name` are detected using the `resourcedetection` processor with
the `gcp` detector. The prometheus receiver sets `service.name` to the
configured `job_name`, and `service.instance.id` is set to the scrape target's
`instance`. The prometheus receiver sets `k8s.namespace.name` when using
`role: pod`.

### Manually Setting location, cluster, or namespace

In GMP, the above attributes are used to identify the `prometheus_target`
monitored resource. As such, it is recommended to avoid writing metric or resource labels
that match these keys. Doing so can cause errors when exporting metrics to
GMP or when trying to query from GMP. So, the recommended way to set them
is with the [resourcedetection processor](../../processor/resourcedetectionprocessor).

If you still need to set `location`, `cluster`, or `namespace` labels
(such as when running in non-GCP environments), you can do so with the
[resource processor](../../processor/resourceprocessor) like so:

```yaml
processors:
  resource:
    attributes:
    - key: "location"
      value: "us-east1"
      action: upsert
```

### Setting cluster, location or namespace using metric labels

This example copies the `location` metric attribute to a new `exported_location`
attribute, then deletes the original `location`. It is recommended to use the `exported_*`
prefix, which is consistent with GMP's behavior.

You can also use the [groupbyattrs processor](../../processor/groupbyattrsprocessor)
to move metric labels to resource labels. This is useful in situations
where, for example, an exporter monitors multiple namespaces (with
each namespace exported as a metric label). One such example is kube-state-metrics.

Using `groupbyattrs` will promote that label to a resource label and 
associate those metrics with the new resource. For example:

```yaml
processors:
  groupbyattrs:
    keys:
    - namespace
    - cluster
    - location
```

## Feature-gates

- `exporter.googlemanagedprometheus.intToDouble`: `Default=false` Change all metric datapoint type to double
  to prevent `Value type for metric <metric name> conflicts with the existing value type` errors:

```shell
"--feature-gates=exporter.googlemanagedprometheus.intToDouble"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Conflicting Value Types

Error: `Value type for metric <metric name> conflicts with the existing value type`

Google Managed Service for Promethueus (and Google Cloud Monitoring) have fixed
value types (INT and DOUBLE) for metrics. Once a metric has been written as an
INT or DOUBLE, attempting to write the other type will fail with the error
above. This commonly occurs when a metric's value type has changed, or when a
mix of INT and DOUBLE for the same metric are being written to the same
project. The recommended way to fix this is to convert all metrics to DOUBLE to
prevent collisions using the `exporter.googlemanagedpromethues.intToDouble`
feature gate, documented above.

Once you enable the feature gate, you will likely see new errors indicating
type collisions, as some existing metrics will be changed from int to double.
To fix this, you need to delete the
[metric descriptor](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/ref_v3/rest/v3/projects.metricDescriptors#MetricDescriptor).
This will delete all existing data for the metric, but will allow it to be
written as a double going forward. The simplest way to do this is by using the
"Try this method" tab in the API reference for
[DeleteMetricDescriptor](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/ref_v3/rest/v3/projects.metricDescriptors/delete).

### Points Written Too Frequently

Error: `One or more points were written more frequently than the maximum sampling period configured for the metric.`

Google Managed Service for Promethueus (and Google Cloud Monitoring)
[limit](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/quotas#custom_metrics_quotas) the
rate at which points can be written to one point every 5 seconds. If you try to
write points more frequently, you will encounter the error above. If you know
that you aren't writing points more frequently than 5 seconds, this can be a
symptom of the Timeseries Collision problem below.

### Timeseries Collision

Error: `Duplicate TimeSeries encountered. Only one point can be written per TimeSeries per request.`

Error: `Points must be written in order. One or more of the points specified had an older start time than the most recent point.`

#### Explanation for Errors

The errors above, and sometimes the
`points were written more frequently than the maximum sampling period` error
can indicate that two metric datapoints are being written without any resource
or metric attributes that distinguish them from each other. We refer to this as
a "Timeseries Collision".

`Duplicate TimeSeries encountered` is the clearest indication of a timeseries
collision. It means that two timeseries in a single request had identical
monitored resource and metric labels.

`Points must be written in order` often indicates that two different collectors
are writing the same timeseries, since they can race to deliver the same
metric with slightly different timestamps. If the later timestamp is delivered
first, it triggers this error. The duplicates don't appear in the same request,
so it doesn't trigger the `Duplicate TimeSeries encountered` error, but they do
still collide.

`points were written more frequently than the maximum sampling period` also
often indicates that two different collectors are writing the same timeseries,
but happens when the first timestamp is delivered first, and the later
timestamp is delivered second. In this case, the points are in order, but are
rejected because they are too close together.

#### Root-causing Timeseries Collisions

There are three main root causes for timeseries collisions:

1. Resource attributes don't distinguish applications.
2. Resource attributes are dropped by the exporter.
3. Metric data point attributes don't distinguish timeseries (very rare).

The most common reason is (1), which means that it can be fixed by adding
resource information. If you are running on GCP, you can use the
[resourcedetection processor](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/processor/resourcedetectionprocessor/README.md)
with the `gcp` detector. If you are running on
Kubernetes (including GKE), we recommend also using the [k8sattributes](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/processor/k8sattributesprocessor/README.md)
processor to at least add `k8s.namespace.name` and `k8s.pod.name`. Finally,
it is important to make sure `service.name` and `service.instance.id` are set
by applications in a way that uniquely identifies each instance.

The next most common reason is (2), which means that the exporter's mapping
logic from OpenTelemetry resource to Google Cloud's `prometheus_target`
monitored resouce didn't preserve a resource attribute that was needed to
distinguish timeseries. This can be mitigated by adding resource
attributes as metric labels using `resource_filters` configuration in the
exporter:

```yaml
  googlemanagedprometheus:
    metric:
      resource_filters:
        regex: ".*"
```

If you need to troubleshoot errors further, start by filtering down to a single
metric from the error message using the `filter` or `transform` processors, and
using the `debug` exporter with `detailed` verbosity:

```yaml
processors:
  filter:
    error_mode: ignore
    metrics:
      - name != "problematic.metric.name"
exporters:
  debug:
    verbosity: detailed
```

That can help identify which metric sources are colliding, so you know which
applications or metrics need additional attributes to ditinguish them from
one-another.
