This exporter converts OpenTelemetry spans to
[AWS X-Ray Segment Documents](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/devguide/xray-api-segmentdocuments.html)
and then sends them directly to X-Ray using the
[PutTraceSegments](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/api/API_PutTraceSegments.html) API.

## Data Conversion

Trace IDs and Span IDs are expected to be originally generated by either AWS API Gateway or AWS ALB and
propagated by them using the `X-Amzn-Trace-Id` HTTP header. However, other generation sources are
supported by replacing fully-random Trace IDs with X-Ray formatted Trace IDs where necessary:

> AWS X-Ray IDs in binary are 128 bits, the same size as W3C Trace Context IDs but the string is formatted to 
> “1-{8 digit hex}-{24 digit hex}“. For example, The W3C format trace ID “4bf92f3577b34da6a3ce929d0e0e4736” is 
> converted to the X-Ray format trace ID “1-4bf92f35-77b34da6a3ce929d0e0e4736".

The `http` object is populated when the `component` attribute value is `grpc` as well as `http`. Other
synchronous call types should also result in the `http` object being populated.

## AWS Specific Attributes

The following AWS-specific Span attributes are supported in addition to the standard names and values
defined in the OpenTelemetry Semantic Conventions.

| Attribute name   | Notes and examples                                                     | Required? |
| :--------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| `aws.operation`  | The name of the API action invoked against an AWS service or resource. | No        |
| `aws.account_id` | The AWS account number if accessing resource in different account.     | No        |
| `aws.region`     | The AWS region if accessing resource in different region from app.     | No        |
| `aws.request_id` | AWS-generated unique identifier for the request.                       | No        |
| `aws.queue_url`  | For operations on an Amazon SQS queue, the queue's URL.                | No        |
| `aws.table_name` | For operations on a DynamoDB table, the name of the table.             | No        |
| `aws.xray.annotations` | The attribute is a slice(list) attribute that contains each of the string keys. If found on the span, the `awsxrayexporter` will use them in addition to the `indexed_attributes` configuration field when categorizing which attributes to index. This can be configured with `"aws.xray.annotations"=["key1", "key2"]` (Java example: `span.setAttribute(stringArrayKey("aws.xray.annotations"), List.of("key1", "key2"))`)             | No        |

Any of these values supplied are used to populate the `aws` object in addition to any relevant data supplied
by the Span Resource object. X-Ray uses this data to generate inferred segments for the remote APIs.

## Exporter Configuration

The following exporter configuration parameters are supported. They mirror and have the same effect as the
comparable AWS X-Ray Daemon configuration values.

## Traces and logs correlation

AWS X-Ray can be integrated with CloudWatch Logs to correlate traces with logs. For this integration to work, the X-Ray
segments must have the AWS Property `cloudwatch_logs` set. This property is set using the AWS X-Ray exporter with the
following values that are evaluated in this order:

1. `aws.log.group.arns` resource attribute.
2. `aws.log.group.names` resource attribute.
3. `aws_log_groups` configuration property.

In the case of multiple values are defined, the value with higher precedence will be used to set the `cloudwatch_logs` AWS Property.

`aws.log.group.arns` and `aws.log.group.names` are slice resource attributes that can be set programmatically.
Alternatively those resource attributes can be set using the [`OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES` environment variable](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/resource/sdk.md#specifying-resource-information-via-an-environment-variable). To set multiple log group names /log group arns, you can use `&`
to separate them. For example, 3 log groups `log-group1`, `log-group2`, and `log-group3` are set in the following command:
```
export OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES="aws.log.group.names=log-group1&log-group2&log-group3"
```

## AWS Credential Configuration

This exporter follows default credential resolution for the
[aws-sdk-go](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/index.html).

Follow the [guidelines](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/v1/developer-guide/configuring-sdk.html) for the
credential configuration.
