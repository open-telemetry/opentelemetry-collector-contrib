# AWS X-Ray Tracing Exporter for OpenTelemetry Collector

This exporter converts OpenTelemetry spans to
[AWS X-Ray Segment Documents](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/devguide/xray-api-segmentdocuments.html)
and then sends them directly to X-Ray using the
[PutTraceSegments](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/api/API_PutTraceSegments.html) API.

## Data Conversion

Trace IDs and Span IDs are expected to be originally generated by either AWS API Gateway or AWS ALB and
propagated by them using the `X-Amzn-Trace-Id` HTTP header. However, other generation sources are
supported by replacing Trace IDs where necessary. For consistency, you may want to consider using the
X-Ray approach if generating Trace IDs within the application.

> AWS X-Ray IDs are the same size as W3C Trace Context IDs but differ in that the first 32 bits of a Trace ID
> is the Unix epoch time when the trace was started. Since X-Ray only allows submission of Trace IDs from the
> past 30 days, received Trace IDs are checked. If outside the allowed range, a replacement is generated by the
> exporter using the current time.

The `http` object is populated when the `component` attribute value is `grpc` as well as `http`. Other
synchronous call types should also result in the `http` object being populated.

## AWS Specific Attributes

The following AWS-specific Span attributes are supported in addition to the standard names and values
defined in the OpenTelemetry Semantic Conventions.

| Attribute name   | Notes and examples                                                     | Required? |
| :--------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| `aws.operation`  | The name of the API action invoked against an AWS service or resource. | No        |
| `aws.account_id` | The AWS account number if accessing resource in different account.     | No        |
| `aws.region`     | The AWS region if accessing resource in different region from app.     | No        |
| `aws.request_id` | AWS-generated unique identifier for the request.                       | No        |
| `aws.queue_url`  | For operations on an Amazon SQS queue, the queue's URL.                | No        |
| `aws.table_name` | For operations on a DynamoDB table, the name of the table.             | No        |

Any of these values supplied are used to populate the `aws` object in addition to any relevant data supplied
by the Span Resource object. X-Ray uses this data to generate inferred segments for the remote APIs.

## Exporter Configuration

The following exporter configuration parameters are supported. They mirror and have the same affect as the
comparable AWS X-Ray Daemon configuration values.

| Name                   | Description                                                                        | Default |
| :--------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| `num_workers`          | Maximum number of concurrent calls to AWS X-Ray to upload documents.               | 8       |
| `endpoint`             | Optionally override the default X-Ray service endpoint.                            |         |
| `request_timeout`      | Number of seconds before timing out a request.                                     | 30      |
| `max_retries`          | Maximun number of attempts to post a batch before failing.                         | 2       |

| `proxy_address`        | Upload segments to AWS X-Ray through a proxy.                                      |         |
| `region`               | Send segments to AWS X-Ray service in a specific region.                           |         |
| `local_mode`           | Local mode to skip EC2 instance metadata check.                                    | false   |
| `resource_arn`         | Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the AWS resource running the collector.              |         |
| `role_arn`             | IAM role to upload segments to a different account.                                |         |
| `indexed_attributes`   | List of attribute names to be converted to X-Ray annotations.                      |         |
| `index_all_attributes` | Enable or disable conversion of all OpenTelemetry attributes to X-Ray annotations. | false   |

## AWS Credential Configuration

This exporter follows default credential resolution for the
[aws-sdk-go](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/index.html).

Follow the [guidelines](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/v1/developer-guide/configuring-sdk.html) for the
credential configuration.
