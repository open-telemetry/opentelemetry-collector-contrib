Exports data via HTTP to [Loki](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/).

## Deprecation notice

This component is **deprecated**: Loki now supports native [OTLP ingestion](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/send-data/otel/) starting from v3. Grafana Cloud also supports [OTLP native ingestion](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana-cloud/send-data/otlp/send-data-otlp) for logs.


### Benefits of the new Loki OpenTelemetry log format

The new format for OpenTelemetry logs introduced in Loki V3 brings the following benefits:

* Native support for the structure of OpenTelemetry logs enabling simpler querying (no more JSON parsing).
* Simplified client configuration to send OpenTelemetry data using the standard OTLP protocol.

### Loki log message format changes for OpenTelemetry logs

See [OpenTelemetry Logs Data Model specification](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/logs/data-model/).

| OpenTelemetry log field | Pre Loki V3 | Loki V3 through the Loki OTLP Endpoint |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| [`Timestamp`](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/logs/data-model/#field-timestamp) | `timestamp` | `timestamp` |
| [`ObservedTimestamp`](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/logs/data-model/#field-observedtimestamp) | Not available | `metadata[observed_timestamp]` |
| [`TraceId`](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/logs/data-model/#field-traceid) | `traceid`  field of the Loki JSON log message | `metadata[trace_id]` |
| [`SpanId`](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/logs/data-model/#field-spanid) | `spanid` field of the Loki JSON log message | `metadata[span_id]` |
| [`TraceFlags`](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/logs/data-model/#field-traceflags) | Not available | `metadata[flags]` |
| [`SeverityText`](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/logs/data-model/#field-severitytext) |  `severity` field of the JSON log message (e.g. `Information`) and `level` label (e.g. `ERROR`, `INFO`...), the `detected_level` label is also available | `metadata[severity_text]`,  the `detected_level` label is also available |
| [`SeverityNumber`](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/logs/data-model/#field-severitynumber) | Not available | `metadata[severity_number]` |
| [`Body`](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/logs/data-model/#field-body) | `body`  field of the Loki JSON log message | The Loki log message. `__line__`in LogQL functions (e.g. `line_format`)|
| [`InstrumentationScope`](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/logs/data-model/#field-instrumentationscope) | `instrumentation_scope_name` field of the JSON log message | `metadata[scope_name]` |
| [`Attributes`](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/logs/data-model/#field-attributes) | JSON fields of the Loki log message | `metadata[xyz]` Where `xyz` is the `_` version of the OTel attribute name (e.g. `thread_name` Loki metadata for the `thread.name` OpenTelemetry attribute)|
| [`Resource`](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/logs/data-model/#field-resource) | `service.name`, `service.namespace`, and `service.instance.id` are promoted as the following labels: `job=[${service.namespace}/]${service.name}`, instance=${service.instance.id}, exporter="OTLP"`.  Other resource attributes are stored as JSON fields of the Loki log message with the prefix `resources_` (e.g. `resources_k8s_namespace_name`) | Default list of resource attributes promoted as Loki labels: `cloud.availability_zone`, `cloud.region`, `container.name`, `deployment.environment`, `k8s.cluster.name`, `k8s.container.name`, `k8s.cronjob.name`, `k8s.daemonset.name`, `k8s.deployment.name`, `k8s.job.name`, `k8s.namespace.name`, `k8s.pod.name`, `k8s.replicaset.name` `k8s.statefulset.name`, `service.instance.id`, `service.name`, `service.namespace`. <br/>Other resource attributes are by default promoted as Loki message metadata.<br/> ℹ️ The list of promoted resource attributes is configurable using Loki’s [distributor config parameter](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/configure/\#distributor) `default_resource_attributes_as_index_labels` when using self managed Loki or opening a support request when using Grafana Cloud |

ℹ️ Additional conversion rules from OpenTelemetry Logs to Loki 

* All special characters, including `.` in attribute and resource attribute names, are converted into `_` when they are mapped as Loki labels or metadata.
* OTel attribute values with complex data types (i.e. arrays, nested structures) are converted into JSON strings

### Migration instructions

#### Instrumentation migration

No changes are needed in the instrumentation layer. OpenTelemetry logs sources like OpenTelemetry SDKs or the [OpenTelemetry Collector File Log Receiver](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/filelogreceiver) don’t have to be modified.

#### Logs collection migration

Replace the OpenTelemetry Collector Loki Exporter by the [OpenTelemetry Collector OTLP HTTP Exporter](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/tree/main/exporter/otlphttpexporter) as OpenTelemetry logs should now be exported as is to the Loki OTLP endpoint.


OpenTelemetry Collector configuration migration

      processors: [...]
      exporters: [loki, ...]

    client_auth:
      username: <<username>>
      password: <<password>>

  pipelines:
    logs:
      receivers: [...]
      processors: [...]
      exporters: [otlphttp/loki, ...]
```

* When using Grafana Cloud, the [Grafana Cloud OTLP endpoint](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana-cloud/send-data/otlp/send-data-otlp/) should be used instead of the Loki OTLP endpoint. The connection details of the Grafana Cloud OTLP endpoint, OTLP HTTP URL and credentials are available using the Grafana Cloud "OpenTelemetry Collector" connection tile.
* The promotion of OpenTelemetry attributes and resource attributes to Loki labels using the `loki.attribute.labels` and `loki.resource.labels` hints is replaced by the list of promoted attributes managed centrally in Loki. 
* The default list of resource attributes promoted as labels (see above) should be sufficient for most use cases.  
* ℹ️ Changes can be made to this list using the Loki [distributor config parameter](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/configure/\#distributor) `default_resource_attributes_as_index_labels` for self managed instances and opening a support ticket for Grafana Cloud.

#### LogQL queries migration

##### From `job` and `instance` to `service_name`, `service_namespace`, and `service_instance_id`

The Loki labels `job` and `instance` are no longer generated and are replaced by the `service_name`, `service_namespace`, and `service_instance_id` labels.

Example:

```
BEFORE
{job="ecommerce/frontend", instance="instance-1234567890"}

AFTER
{service_name="frontend", service_namespace="ecommerce", service_instance_id="instance-1234567890"}
```

##### From `| json | an_attribute=...` to `{an_attribute=...}` or `| an_attribute=...`

OTel log attributes, resource attributes, and fields are no longer stored in the JSON message but are stored as:
* Loki message labels for promoted resource attributes (see list above),
* Loki message metadata for other resource attributes, log attributes, and log fields.

LogQL statements `| json | an_attribute=...` must be converted to:

* Promoted resource attributes: `{an_attribute=...}`
* For other resource attributes, log attributes, and log fields: `| an_attribute=...`

Example:

```
BEFORE
{exporter="OTLP", job="frontend"} | json | resources_deployment_environment="production"

AFTER
{service_name="frontend"} | deployment_environment="production"
```

##### From `| json | traceid=...` and `| json | spanid=...` to `| trace_id=...` and `| span_id=...`

The log fields `SpanID` and `TraceId` were stored as the JSON fields `spanid` and `traceid`; they are now stored as `metadata[span_id]` and `metadata[trace_id]`, LogQL queries must be changed accordingly.

`TraceID` filters like `| json | traceid=<<traceId>> ...` and `|= <<traceId>> ...` must be converted to `| trace_id=<<traceId>> ...` where `<<traceId>>` and <<spanId>> are the values you search for.  
Similarly, `SpanID` filters like `| json | spanid=<<spanid>> ...` and `|=<<spanid>> ...` must be converted to `| span_id=<<spanid>> ...`.

Example:

```
BEFORE
{exporter="OTLP", job="/frontend"} |= "00960a472ea5b87954ca07902d66f914"

AFTER
{service_name="frontend"} | trace_id="00960a472ea5b87954ca07902d66f914"
```

##### From `line_format {{.body}}` to `line_format {{__line__}}`

The `{{.body}}` element of the JSON payload that used to hold the OTel log message body is now the message of the Loki log line and should be referenced as `{{__line__}}` in `line_format` calls.

Example:

```
BEFORE
{exporter="OTLP", job="frontend"} | json | line_format `[{{.level}}] {{.body}}`

AFTER
{service_name="frontend"} | line_format `[{{.detected_level}}] {{__line__}}`
```

#### Grafana visualizations migration

Navigation between traces and logs must be updated to account for the new Loki format form OpenTelemetry logs.

##### Tempo data source: Trace to Logs

To enable the "trace to logs" navigation from Tempo to Loki, navigate to the Grafana Tempo data source configuration screen, in the "Trace to logs" section, 

* Select a Loki data source on which logs to trace is configured for the new Loki format for OTel logs as described in the next section
* Select "Use custom query" and specify the query:

    ```
    {${__tags}} | trace_id="${__span.traceId}"
    ```

##### Loki data source: Log to Trace

To enable the "logs to trace" navigation from Loki to Tempo, navigate to the Grafana Loki data source configuration screen, in the "Derived fields" section, update or create a derived field with:
* Name: `Trace ID`
* Type: `Label` (note that this `Label` name may be misleading because it also supports Loki message metadata)
* Label: `trace_id`
* Internal link: activated
* Select the Tempo data source on which "trace to logs" is configured as described above

## Getting Started with the deprecated OpenTelemetry Collector Loki Exporter

The following settings are required:

- `endpoint` (no default): The target URL to send Loki log streams to (e.g.: `http://loki:3100/loki/api/v1/push`).
- `default_labels_enabled` (optional): The map that allows to disable default labels: `exporter`, `job`, `instance`, `level`. 
If `default_labels_enabled` is omitted then default labels will be added. If one of the labels is omitted in `default_labels_enabled` then this label will be added.
**Important to remember**: 
If all default labels are disabled and there are no other labels added then the log entry would be dropped because at least one label should be present to successfully put the log record into Loki.
The metric `otelcol_lokiexporter_send_failed_due_to_missing_labels` shows how many log records were dropped because no labels were specified 

Example:
```yaml
exporters:
  loki:
    endpoint: https://loki.example.com:3100/loki/api/v1/push
    default_labels_enabled:
      exporter: false
      job: true
```

## Configuration via attribute hints

### Labels
The Loki exporter can convert OTLP resource and log attributes into Loki labels, which are indexed. For that, you need to configure
hints, specifying which attributes should be placed as labels. The hints are themselves attributes and will be ignored when
exporting to Loki. The following example uses the `attributes` processor to hint the Loki exporter to set the `event.domain`
attribute as label and the `resource` processor to give a hint to the Loki exporter to set the `service.name` as label.

```yaml
processors:
  attributes:
    actions:
      - action: insert
        key: loki.attribute.labels
        value: event.domain

  resource:
    attributes:
      - action: insert
        key: loki.resource.labels
        value: service.name
```

Currently, Loki does not support label names with dots. 
That's why lokiexporter normalizes label names to follow [Prometheus label names standard](../../pkg/translator/prometheus/README.md#Labels) before sending requests to Loki.

The promotion of multiple resource and log attributes to labels is done with single action with comma-separated desired labels:
```yaml
processors:
  attributes:
    actions:
      - action: insert
        key: loki.attribute.labels
        value: event.domain, event.name

  resource:
    attributes:
      - action: insert
        key: loki.resource.labels
        value: service.name, service.namespace
```

Default labels are always set unless they are disabled with `default_labels_enabled` setting:
- `job=service.namespace/service.name`
- `instance=service.instance.id`
- `exporter=OTLP`
- `level=severity`

If `service.name` and `service.namespace` are present then `job=service.namespace/service.name` is set

If `service.name` is present and `service.namespace` is not present then `job=service.name` is set

If `service.name` is not present and `service.namespace` is present then `job` label is not set

If `service.instance.id` is present then `instance=service.instance.id` is set

If `service.instance.id` is not present then `instance` label is not set

The full list of settings exposed for this exporter are documented in [config.go](./config.go) with detailed sample
configurations in [testdata/config.yaml](./testdata/config.yaml).

For more information, see [how to send logs to Grafana Loki using the OpenTelemetry Collector](https://grafana.com/docs/opentelemetry/collector/send-logs-to-loki/)

### Tenant information

It is recommended to use the [`header_setter`](../../extension/headerssetterextension/README.md) extension to configure the tenant information to send to Loki. In case a static tenant
should be used, you can make use of the `headers` option for regular HTTP client settings, like the following:

```yaml
exporters:
  loki:
    endpoint: http://localhost:3100/loki/api/v1/push
    headers:
      "X-Scope-OrgID": acme
```

It is also possible to provide the `loki.tenant` attribute hint that specifies
which resource or log attributes value should be used as a tenant. For example:

```yaml
processors:
  resource:
    attributes:
    - action: insert
      key: loki.tenant
      value: host.name
```

In this case the value of the `host.name` resource attribute is used to group logs
by tenant and send requests with the `X-Scope-OrgID` header set to relevant tenants.

If the `loki.tenant` hint attribute is present in both resource and log attributes,
then the look-up for a tenant value from resource attributes takes precedence.

### Format
To choose the format used for writing log lines by the exporter use the `loki.format` hint. For example:

```yaml
processors:
  resource:
    attributes:
    - action: insert
      key: loki.format
      value: logfmt
```

The following formats are supported:

- `logfmt`: Write logs as [logfmt](https://brandur.org/logfmt) lines.
- `json`: Write logs as JSON objects. It is the default format if no hint is present.
- `raw`: Write the body of the log message as string representation.

## Severity

OpenTelemetry uses `record.severityNumber` to track log levels where loki uses `record.attributes.level` for the same. The exporter automatically maps the two, except if a "level" attribute already exists.

## Advanced Configuration

Several helper files are leveraged to provide additional capabilities automatically:

- [HTTP settings](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/main/config/confighttp/README.md)
- [Queuing and retry settings](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/main/exporter/exporterhelper/README.md)
