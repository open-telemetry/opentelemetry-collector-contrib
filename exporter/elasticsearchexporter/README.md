This exporter supports sending OpenTelemetry logs and traces to [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch).

## Configuration options

- `endpoints`: List of Elasticsearch URLs. If `endpoints` and `cloudid` are missing, the
  ELASTICSEARCH_URL environment variable will be used.
- `cloudid` (optional):
  [ID](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/cloud/current/ec-cloud-id.html) of the
  Elastic Cloud Cluster to publish events to. The `cloudid` can be used instead
  of `endpoints`.
- `num_workers` (optional): Number of workers publishing bulk requests concurrently.
- `index` (DEPRECATED, please use `logs_index` for logs, `traces_index` for traces): The
  [index](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/indices.html)
  or [data stream](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/data-streams.html)
  name to publish events to. The default value is `logs-generic-default`.
- `logs_index`: The
  [index](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/indices.html)
  or [data stream](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/data-streams.html)
  name to publish events to. The default value is `logs-generic-default`
- `logs_dynamic_index` (optional):
  takes resource or log record attribute named `elasticsearch.index.prefix` and `elasticsearch.index.suffix`
  resulting dynamically prefixed / suffixed indexing based on `logs_index`. (priority: resource attribute > log record attribute)
  - `enabled`(default=false): Enable/Disable dynamic index for log records
- `traces_index`: The
  [index](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/indices.html)
  or [data stream](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/data-streams.html)
  name to publish traces to. The default value is `traces-generic-default`.
- `traces_dynamic_index` (optional):
  takes resource or span attribute named `elasticsearch.index.prefix` and `elasticsearch.index.suffix`
  resulting dynamically prefixed / suffixed indexing based on `traces_index`. (priority: resource attribute > span attribute)
  - `enabled`(default=false): Enable/Disable dynamic index for trace spans
- `logstash_format` (optional): Logstash format compatibility. Traces or Logs data can be written into an index in logstash format.
  - `enabled`(default=false):  Enable/Disable Logstash format compatibility. When `logstash_format.enabled` is `true`, the index name is composed using `traces/logs_index` or `traces/logs_dynamic_index` as prefix and the date, 
                                e.g: If `traces/logs_index` or `traces/logs_dynamic_index` is equals to `otlp-generic-default` your index will become `otlp-generic-default-YYYY.MM.DD`. 
                                The last string appended belongs to the date when the data is being generated.
  - `prefix_separator`(default=`-`): Set a separator between logstash_prefix and date.
  - `date_format`(default=`%Y.%m.%d`): Time format (based on strftime) to generate the second part of the Index name.
- `pipeline` (optional): Optional [Ingest pipeline](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/ingest.html) ID used for processing documents published by the exporter.
- `flush`: Event bulk indexer buffer flush settings
  - `bytes` (default=5242880): Write buffer flush size limit.
  - `interval` (default=30s): Write buffer flush time limit.
- `retry`: Elasticsearch bulk request retry settings
  - `enabled` (default=true): Enable/Disable request retry on error. Failed requests are retried with exponential backoff.
  - `max_requests` (default=3): Number of HTTP request retries.
  - `initial_interval` (default=100ms): Initial waiting time if a HTTP request failed.
  - `max_interval` (default=1m): Max waiting time if a HTTP request failed.
  - `retry_on_status` (default=[429, 500, 502, 503, 504]): Status codes that trigger request or document level retries. Request level retry and document level retry status codes are shared and cannot be configured separately. To avoid duplicates, it is recommended to set it to `[429]`. WARNING: The default will be changed to `[429]` in the future.
- `mapping`: Events are encoded to JSON. The `mapping` allows users to
  configure additional mapping rules.
  - `mode` (default=none): The fields naming mode. valid modes are:
    - `none`: Use original fields and event structure from the OTLP event.
    - `ecs`: Try to map fields defined in the
             [OpenTelemetry Semantic Conventions](https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions) (version 1.22.0)
             to [Elastic Common Schema (ECS)](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/ecs/current/index.html). :warning: This mode's behavior is unstable, it is currently undergoing changes
    - `raw`: Omit the `Attributes.` string prefixed to field names for log and 
             span attributes as well as omit the `Events.` string prefixed to
             field names for span events. 
  - `fields` (optional): Configure additional fields mappings.
  - `file` (optional): Read additional field mappings from the provided YAML file.
  - `dedup` (default=true): Try to find and remove duplicate fields/attributes
    from events before publishing to Elasticsearch. Some structured logging
    libraries can produce duplicate fields (for example zap). Elasticsearch
    will reject documents that have duplicate fields.
  - `dedot` (default=true): When enabled attributes with `.` will be split into
    proper json objects.
- `sending_queue`
  - `enabled` (default = false)
  - `num_consumers` (default = 10): Number of consumers that dequeue batches; ignored if `enabled` is `false`
  - `queue_size` (default = 1000): Maximum number of batches kept in queue; ignored if `enabled` is `false`;
### HTTP settings

- `read_buffer_size` (default=0): Read buffer size of HTTP client.
- `write_buffer_size` (default=0): Write buffer size of HTTP client.
- `timeout` (default=90s): HTTP request time limit.
- `headers` (optional): Headers to be sent with each HTTP request.

### Security and Authentication settings

- `user` (optional): Username used for HTTP Basic Authentication.
- `password` (optional): Password used for HTTP Basic Authentication.
- `api_key` (optional):  Authorization [API Key](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/security-api-create-api-key.html) in "encoded" format.

### TLS settings
- `ca_file` (optional): Root Certificate Authority (CA) certificate, for
  verifying the server's identity, if TLS is enabled.
- `cert_file` (optional): Client TLS certificate.
- `key_file` (optional): Client TLS key.
- `insecure` (optional): In gRPC when set to true, this is used to disable the client transport security. In HTTP, this disables verifying the server's certificate chain and host name.
- `insecure_skip_verify` (optional): Will enable TLS but not verify the certificate.

### Node Discovery

The Elasticsearch Exporter will check Elasticsearch regularly for available
nodes and updates the list of hosts if discovery is enabled. Newly discovered
nodes will automatically be used for load balancing.

- `discover`:
  - `on_start` (optional): If enabled the exporter queries Elasticsearch
    for all known nodes in the cluster on startup.
  - `interval` (optional): Interval to update the list of Elasticsearch nodes.
