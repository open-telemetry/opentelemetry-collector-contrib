This exporter supports sending logs, metrics and traces to [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch).

## Configuration options

Exactly one of the following settings is required:

- `endpoint` (no default): The target Elasticsearch URL to which data will be sent
  (e.g. `https://elasticsearch:9200`)
- `endpoints` (no default): A list of Elasticsearch URLs to which data will be sent,
  attempted in round-robin order
- `cloudid` (no default): The [Elastic Cloud ID](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/cloud/current/ec-cloud-id.html)
  of the Elastic Cloud Cluster to which data will be sent (e.g. `foo:YmFyLmNsb3VkLmVzLmlvJGFiYzEyMyRkZWY0NTY=`)

When the above settings are missing, `endpoints` will default to the
comma-separated `ELASTICSEARCH_URL` environment variable.

Elasticsearch credentials may be configured via [Authentication configuration][configauth] settings.
As a shortcut, the following settings are also supported:

- `user` (optional): Username used for HTTP Basic Authentication.
- `password` (optional): Password used for HTTP Basic Authentication.
- `api_key` (optional): [Elasticsearch API Key] in "encoded" format.

Example:

```yaml
exporters:
  elasticsearch:
    endpoint: https://elastic.example.com:9200
    auth:
      authenticator: basicauth

extensions:
  basicauth:
    client_auth:
      username: elastic
      password: changeme

······

service:
  extensions: [basicauth]
  pipelines:
    logs:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [elasticsearch]
    traces:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [elasticsearch]
```

## Advanced configuration

### HTTP settings

The Elasticsearch exporter supports common [HTTP Configuration Settings][confighttp], except for `compression` (all requests are uncompressed).
As a consequence of supporting [confighttp], the Elasticsearch exporter also supports common [TLS Configuration Settings][configtls].

The Elasticsearch exporter sets `timeout` (HTTP request timeout) to 90s by default.
All other defaults are as defined by [confighttp].

### Queuing

The Elasticsearch exporter supports the common [`sending_queue` settings][exporterhelper]. However, the sending queue is currently disabled by default.

### Elasticsearch document routing

Telemetry data will be written to signal specific data streams by default:
logs to `logs-generic-default`, metrics to `metrics-generic-default`, and traces to `traces-generic-default`.
This can be customised through the following settings:

- `index` (DEPRECATED, please use `logs_index` for logs, `metrics_index` for metrics, `traces_index` for traces): The [index] or [data stream] name to publish events to.
   The default value is `logs-generic-default`.

- `logs_index`: The [index] or [data stream] name to publish events to.  The default value is `logs-generic-default`

- `logs_dynamic_index` (optional): uses resource, scope, or log record attributes to dynamically construct index name.
  - `enabled`(default=false): Enable/Disable dynamic index for log records.  If `data_stream.dataset` or `data_stream.namespace` exist in attributes (precedence: log record attribute > scope attribute > resource attribute), they will be used to dynamically construct index name in the form `logs-${data_stream.dataset}-${data_stream.namespace}`. Otherwise, if
    `elasticsearch.index.prefix` or `elasticsearch.index.suffix` exist in attributes (precedence: resource attribute > scope attribute > log record attribute), they will be used to dynamically construct index name in the form `${elasticsearch.index.prefix}${logs_index}${elasticsearch.index.suffix}`. Otherwise, the index name falls back to `logs-generic-default`, and `logs_index` config will be ignored. Except for prefix/suffix attribute presence, the resulting docs will contain the corresponding `data_stream.*` fields.

- `metrics_index` (optional): The [index] or [data stream] name to publish metrics to. The default value is `metrics-generic-default`.
  ⚠️ Note that metrics support is currently in development.

- `metrics_dynamic_index` (optional): uses resource, scope or data point attributes to dynamically construct index name.
  ⚠️ Note that metrics support is currently in development.
  - `enabled`(default=true): Enable/disable dynamic index for metrics. If `data_stream.dataset` or `data_stream.namespace` exist in attributes (precedence: data point attribute > scope attribute > resource attribute), they will be used to dynamically construct index name in the form `metrics-${data_stream.dataset}-${data_stream.namespace}`. Otherwise, if
 `elasticsearch.index.prefix` or `elasticsearch.index.suffix` exist in attributes (precedence: resource attribute > scope attribute > data point attribute), they will be used to dynamically construct index name in the form `${elasticsearch.index.prefix}${metrics_index}${elasticsearch.index.suffix}`. Otherwise, the index name falls back to `metrics-generic-default`, and `metrics_index` config will be ignored. Except for prefix/suffix attribute presence, the resulting docs will contain the corresponding `data_stream.*` fields.

- `traces_index`: The [index] or [data stream] name to publish traces to. The default value is `traces-generic-default`.

- `traces_dynamic_index` (optional): uses resource, scope, or span attributes to dynamically construct index name.
  - `enabled`(default=false): Enable/Disable dynamic index for trace spans. If `data_stream.dataset` or `data_stream.namespace` exist in attributes (precedence: span attribute > scope attribute > resource attribute), they will be used to dynamically construct index name in the form `traces-${data_stream.dataset}-${data_stream.namespace}`. Otherwise, if
    `elasticsearch.index.prefix` or `elasticsearch.index.suffix` exist in attributes (precedence: resource attribute > scope attribute > span attribute), they will be used to dynamically construct index name in the form `${elasticsearch.index.prefix}${traces_index}${elasticsearch.index.suffix}`. Otherwise, the index name falls back to `traces-generic-default`, and `traces_index` config will be ignored. Except for prefix/suffix attribute presence, the resulting docs will contain the corresponding `data_stream.*` fields.

- `logstash_format` (optional): Logstash format compatibility. Logs, metrics and traces can be written into an index in Logstash format.
  - `enabled`(default=false):  Enable/disable Logstash format compatibility. When `logstash_format.enabled` is `true`, the index name is composed using `(logs|metrics|traces)_index` or `(logs|metrics|traces)_dynamic_index` as prefix and the date as suffix,
    e.g: If `logs_index` or `logs_dynamic_index` is equal to `logs-generic-default`, your index will become `logs-generic-default-YYYY.MM.DD`.
    The last string appended belongs to the date when the data is being generated.
  - `prefix_separator`(default=`-`): Set a separator between logstash_prefix and date.
  - `date_format`(default=`%Y.%m.%d`): Time format (based on strftime) to generate the second part of the Index name.

### Elasticsearch document mapping

The Elasticsearch exporter supports several document schemas and preprocessing
behaviours, which may be configured through the following settings:

- `mapping`: Events are encoded to JSON. The `mapping` allows users to
  configure additional mapping rules.
  - `mode` (default=none): The fields naming mode. valid modes are:
    - `none`: Use original fields and event structure from the OTLP event.
    - `ecs`: Try to map fields to [Elastic Common Schema (ECS)][ECS]
    - `otel`: Elastic's preferred "OTel-native" mapping mode. Uses original fields and event structure from the OTLP event.
          :warning: This mode's behavior is unstable, it is currently is experimental and undergoing changes.
          There's a special treatment for the following attributes: `data_stream.type`, `data_stream.dataset`, `data_stream.namespace`. Instead of serializing these values under the `*attributes.*` namespace, they're put at the root of the document, to conform with the conventions of the data stream naming scheme that maps these as `constant_keyword` fields.

    - `raw`: Omit the `Attributes.` string prefixed to field names for log and 
             span attributes as well as omit the `Events.` string prefixed to
             field names for span events. 
  - `dedup` (DEPRECATED). This configuration is deprecated and non-operational,
    and will be removed in the future. Object keys are always deduplicated to
    avoid Elasticsearch rejecting documents.
  - `dedot` (default=true; DEPRECATED, in future dedotting will always be enabled
    for ECS mode, and never for other modes): When enabled attributes with `.`
    will be split into proper json objects.

#### ECS mapping mode

> [!WARNING]
> The ECS mode mapping mode is currently undergoing changes, and its behaviour is unstable.

In ECS mapping mode, the Elastisearch Exporter attempts to map fields from
[OpenTelemetry Semantic Conventions][SemConv] (version 1.22.0) to [Elastic Common Schema][ECS].
This mode may be used for compatibility with existing dashboards that work with ECS.

### Elasticsearch ingest pipeline

Documents may be optionally passed through an [Elasticsearch Ingest pipeline] prior to indexing.
This can be configured through the following settings:

- `pipeline` (optional): ID of an [Elasticsearch Ingest pipeline] used for processing documents published by the exporter.

### Elasticsearch bulk indexing

The Elasticsearch exporter uses the [Elasticsearch Bulk API] for indexing documents.
The behaviour of this bulk indexing can be configured with the following settings:

- `num_workers` (default=runtime.NumCPU()): Number of workers publishing bulk requests concurrently.
- `flush`: Event bulk indexer buffer flush settings
  - `bytes` (default=5000000): Write buffer flush size limit.
  - `interval` (default=30s): Write buffer flush time limit.
- `retry`: Elasticsearch bulk request retry settings
  - `enabled` (default=true): Enable/Disable request retry on error. Failed requests are retried with exponential backoff.
  - `max_requests` (default=3): Number of HTTP request retries.
  - `initial_interval` (default=100ms): Initial waiting time if a HTTP request failed.
  - `max_interval` (default=1m): Max waiting time if a HTTP request failed.
  - `retry_on_status` (default=[429, 500, 502, 503, 504]): Status codes that trigger request or document level retries. Request level retry and document level retry status codes are shared and cannot be configured separately. To avoid duplicates, it is recommended to set it to `[429]`. WARNING: The default will be changed to `[429]` in the future.

### Elasticsearch node discovery

The Elasticsearch Exporter will regularly check Elasticsearch for available nodes.
Newly discovered nodes will automatically be used for load balancing.
Settings related to node discovery are:

- `discover`:
  - `on_start` (optional): If enabled the exporter queries Elasticsearch
    for all known nodes in the cluster on startup.
  - `interval` (optional): Interval to update the list of Elasticsearch nodes.

Node discovery can be disabled by setting `discover.interval` to 0.

### Telemetry settings

The Elasticsearch Exporter's own telemetry settings for testing and debugging purposes.

⚠️ This is experimental and may change at any time.

- `telemetry`:
  - `log_request_body` (default=false): Logs Elasticsearch client request body as a field in a log line at DEBUG level. It requires `service::telemetry::logs::level` to be set to `debug`. WARNING: Enabling this config may expose sensitive data.
  - `log_response_body` (default=false): Logs Elasticsearch client response body as a field in a log line at DEBUG level. It requires `service::telemetry::logs::level` to be set to `debug`. WARNING: Enabling this config may expose sensitive data.

## Exporting metrics

Metrics support is currently in development.
The only metric types supported are:

- Gauge
- Sum

Other metric types (Histogram, Exponential Histogram, Summary) are ignored.
