  retain_initial_value_of_delta_metric:
    description: RetainInitialValueOfDeltaMetric is the flag to signal that the initial value of a metric is a valid datapoint. The default behavior is that the first value occurrence of a metric is set as the baseline for the calculation of the delta to the next occurrence. With this flag set to true the exporter will instead use this first value as the initial delta value. This is especially useful when handling low frequency metrics.
