Exports telemetry data using the
[OTel-Arrow](https://github.com/open-telemetry/otel-arrow) protocol and standard [OTLP](
https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/protocol/otlp.md)
protocol via gRPC.

## Getting Started

The OTel-Arrow exporter is an extension of the core OpenTelemetry
Collector [OTLP
exporter](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/tree/main/exporter/otlpexporter)
component with additional support for the
[OTel-Arrow](https://github.com/open-telemetry/otel-arrow) protocol.

OTel-Arrow supports column-oriented data transport using the Apache
Arrow data format.  This component converts OTLP data into an
optimized representation and then sends batches of data using Apache
Arrow to encode the stream.  The [OTel-Arrow
receiver](https://github.com/open-telemetry/otel-arrow/tree/main/collector/receiver/otelarrowreceiver)
component contains logic to reverse the process used in this
component.

The use of an OTel-Arrow exporter-receiver pair is recommended when
the network is expensive.  Typically, expect to see a 50% reduction in
bandwidth compared with the same data being sent using standard
OTLP/gRPC and gzip compression.

This component includes all the features and configuration of the core
OTLP exporter, making it possible to upgrade from the core component
simply by replacing "otlp" with "otelarrow" as the component name in
the collector configuration.

To enable the OTel-Arrow exporter, include it in the list of exporters
for a pipeline.  Two settings are required:

- `endpoint` (no default): host:port to which the exporter is going to send OTLP trace data,
using the gRPC protocol. The valid syntax is described
[here](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/naming.md).
If a scheme of `https` is used then client transport security is enabled and overrides the `insecure` setting.
- `tls`: see [TLS Configuration Settings](../../config/configtls/README.md) for the full set of available options.

Example:

```yaml
exporters:
  otelarrow/secure:
    endpoint: external-collector:4317
    tls:
      cert_file: file.cert
      key_file: file.key
  otelarrow/insecure:
    endpoint: internal-collector:4317
    tls:
      insecure: true
```

By default, `zstd` compression is enabled at the gRPC level. See
[compression
comparison](../../config/configgrpc/README.md#compression-comparison)
for details and benchmark information.  To disable gRPC-level
compression, configure as follows:

```yaml
exporters:
  otelarrow:
    compression: none
    endpoint: ...
    tls: ...
```

## Configuration

Several helper files are leveraged to provide additional capabilities automatically:

- [gRPC settings](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/main/config/configgrpc/README.md)
- [TLS and mTLS settings](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/main/config/configtls/README.md)
- [Queuing, retry and timeout settings](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/main/exporter/exporterhelper/README.md)

### Arrow-specific Configuration

In the `arrow` configuration block, the following settings enable and
disable the use of OTel Arrow as opposed to standard OTLP.

- `disabled` (default: false): disables use of Arrow, causing the exporter to use standard OTLP
- `disable_downgrade` (default: false): prevents this exporter from using standard OTLP.

The following settings determine the resources that the exporter will use:

- `num_streams` (default: number of CPUs): the number of concurrent Arrow streams
- `max_stream_lifetime` (default: unlimited): duration after which streams are recycled.

### Network Configuration

This component uses `round_robin` by default as the gRPC load
balancer.  This can be modified using the `balancer_name` setting, for
example, to configure the `pick_first` balancer:

```yaml
exporters:
  otelarrow:
    balancer_name: pick_first
    endpoint: ...
    tls: ...
```

When the server or an intermediate proxy uses a keepalive setting, the
Arrow-specific `max_stream_lifetime` setting is critical to avoiding
abrupt termination of Arrow streams, which causes retries of the
in-flight requests.  The maximum stream lifetime should be set to a
value less than the minimum of the server's keepalive parameter (and
any of the intermediate proxies), plus the export timeout.

```yaml
exporters:
  otelarrow:
    timeout: 30s
    arrow:
      max_stream_lifetime: 9m30s
    endpoint: ...
    tls: ...
```

When this is configured, the stream will terminate cleanly without
causing retries, with `OK` gRPC status.

[The corresponding `otelarrowreceiver` keepalive setting, that is
compatible with the one above,
reads](../../receiver/otelarrowreceiver/README.md):

```
receivers:
  otelarrow:
    protocols:
      grpc:
        keepalive:
          server_parameters:
            max_connection_age: 1m
            max_connection_age_grace: 10m
```

### Exporter metrics

In addition to the the standard
[exporterhelper](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/main/exporter/exporterhelper/README.md)
and
[obsreport](https://pkg.go.dev/go.opentelemetry.io/collector/obsreport)
metrics, this component provides network-level measurement instruments
which we anticipate will become part of `exporterhelper` and/or
`obsreport` in the future.  At the `normal` level of metrics detail:

- `exporter_sent`: uncompressed bytes sent, prior to compression
- `exporter_sent_wire`: compressed bytes sent, on the wire.

Arrow's compression performance can be derived by dividing the average
`exporter_sent` value by the average `exporter_sent_wire` value.

At the `detailed` metrics detail level, information about the stream
of data being returned to the exporter will be instrumented:

- `exporter_recv`: uncompressed bytes received, prior to compression
- `exporter_recv_wire`: compressed bytes received, on the wire.

### Experimental Configuration

The exporter supports configuring compression at the [Arrow
columnar-protocol
level](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/Columnar.html#format-ipc).

- `payload_compression`: compression applied at the Arrow IPC level, "none" by default, "zstd" supported.

The exporter uses the signal-specific Arrow stream methods (i.e.,
`ArrowTraces`, `ArrowLogs`, and `ArrowMetrics`) by default.  There is
an option to use the generic `ArrowStream` method instead.

- `enable_mixed_signals` (default: false): Use `ArrowStream` instead of per-signal stream methods.

This option has the potential to enable the future exporter to cross
signals, meaning to allow traces, metrics and logs to refer to the
same shared-data items across a single stream.  Presently, there is no
cross-signal compression benefit, this option simply causes one method
name instead of three method names to be used by the exporter
instances of different signal types.
