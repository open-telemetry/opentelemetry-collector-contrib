      payload_compression:
        description: PayloadCompression is applied on the Arrow IPC stream internally and may have different results from using gRPC-level compression.  This is disabled by default, since gRPC-level compression is enabled by default.  This can be set to "zstd" to turn on Arrow-Zstd compression. Note that `Zstd` applies to gRPC, not Arrow compression.

      zstd:
        description: Zstd settings apply to OTel-Arrow use of gRPC specifically. Note that when multiple Otel-Arrow exporters are configured their settings will be applied in arbitrary order. Identical Zstd settings are recommended when multiple OTel-Arrow exporters are in use.

  metadata_keys:
    description: MetadataKeys is a list of client.Metadata keys that will be used to form distinct exporters.  If this setting is empty, a single exporter instance will be used.  When this setting is not empty, one exporter will be used per distinct combination of values for the listed metadata keys. Empty value and unset metadata are treated as distinct cases. Entries are case-insensitive.  Duplicated entries will trigger a validation error.
