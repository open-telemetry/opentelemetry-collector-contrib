Exports OTEL Events (SpanEvent in Tracing added by AddEvent API) as Alerts to [Alertmanager](https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/latest/alertmanager/) back-end to notify Errors or Change events.

Supported pipeline types: traces

## Getting Started

The following settings are required:

- `endpoint`: Alertmanager endpoint to send events
- `severity`: Default severity for Alerts


The following settings are optional:

- `timeout` `sending_queue` and `retry_on_failure` settings as provided by [Exporter Helper](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/tree/main/exporter/exporterhelper#configuration).
- [HTTP settings](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/main/config/confighttp/README.md)
- [TLS and mTLS settings](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/main/config/configtls/README.md)
- `generator_url` is the source of the alerts to be used in Alertmanager's payload. The default value is "opentelemetry-collector", and can be set to the URL of the opentelemetry collector.
- `severity_attribute` is the SpanEvent Attribute name which can be used instead of default severity string in Alert payload.
   e.g.: If `severity_attribute` is set to "foo" and the SpanEvent has an attribute called foo, foo's attribute value will be used as the severity value for that particular Alert generated from the SpanEvent.
- `api_version` is the API version of [Alertmanager](https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/latest/clients/). By default the value is set to "v2" and can be overridden to "v1" if using an older version of Alertmanager.
- `event_labels` is the list of Event Attributes that will be captured as Labels in the Alert payload if value exists.

Example config:

```yaml
exporters:
  alertmanager:
  alertmanager/2:
    endpoint: "https://a.new.alertmanager.target:9093"
    severity: "debug"
    severity_attribute: "foo"
    api_version: "v2"
    event_labels: ["foo", "bar"]
    tls:
      cert_file: /var/lib/mycert.pem
      key_file: /var/lib/key.pem
    timeout: 10s
    sending_queue:
      enabled: true
      num_consumers: 2
      queue_size: 10
    retry_on_failure:
      enabled: true
      initial_interval: 10s
      max_interval: 60s
      max_elapsed_time: 10m
    generator_url: "opentelemetry-collector"
```
