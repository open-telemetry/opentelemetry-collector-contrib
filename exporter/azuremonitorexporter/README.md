This exporter sends logs, traces and metrics to [Azure Monitor](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/).

## Configuration

To configure the Azure Monitor Exporter, you must specify one of the following settings:

- `connection_string` (recommended): The Azure Application Insights Connection String is required to send telemetry data to the monitoring service. It is the recommended method for configuring the exporter, aligning with Azure Monitor's best practices. If you need guidance on creating Azure resources, please refer to the step-by-step guides to [Create an Application Insights resource](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/app/create-new-resource) and [find your connection string](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/app/sdk-connection-string?tabs=net#find-your-connection-string).
- `instrumentation_key`: Application Insights instrumentation key, which can be found in the Application Insights resource in the Azure Portal. While it is currently supported, its use is discouraged and it is slated for deprecation. It is highly encouraged to use the `connection_string` setting for new configurations and migrate existing configurations to use the `connection_string` as soon as possible.

### Environment Variable Support

In addition to the above configuration options, the Azure Monitor Exporter now supports setting the connection string via the `APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING` environment variable. This method is particularly useful for cloud or containerized environments where managing configuration through environment variables is standard practice.

**Note:** If both the environment variable and the `connection_string` configuration option are provided, the environment variable takes precedence.

### Configuration Options

**Important**: Only one of `connection_string` or `instrumentation_key` should be specified in your configuration. If both are provided, `connection_string` will be used as the priority setting.

The following settings can be optionally configured:

- `endpoint` (default = `https://dc.services.visualstudio.com/v2/track`): The endpoint URL where data will be submitted. While this option remains available, it is important to note that the use of the `connection_string` is recommended, as it encompasses the endpoint information. The direct configuration of the `endpoint` is considered to be on a deprecation path.
- `maxbatchsize` (default = 1024): The maximum number of telemetry items that can be submitted in each request. If this many items are buffered, the buffer will be flushed before `maxbatchinterval` expires.
- `maxbatchinterval` (default = 10s): The maximum time to wait before sending a batch of telemetry.
- `spaneventsenabled` (default = false): Enables export of span events.
- `sending_queue`
  - `enabled` (default = false)
  - `num_consumers` (default = 10): Number of consumers that dequeue batches; ignored if `enabled` is `false`
  - `queue_size` (default = 1000): Maximum number of batches kept in memory before data; ignored if `enabled` is `false`
  - `storage` (default = `none`): When set, enables persistence and uses the component specified as a storage extension for the persistent queue

Example:

```yaml
# Recommended Configuration:
# It is highly recommended to use the connection string which includes the InstrumentationKey and IngestionEndpoint
# This is the preferred method over using 'instrumentation_key' alone.
exporters:
  azuremonitor:
    connection_string: "InstrumentationKey=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000;IngestionEndpoint=https://ingestion.azuremonitor.com/"
```

(or)

```yaml
# Legacy Configuration:
# The use of 'instrumentation_key' alone is not recommended and will be deprecated in the future. It is advised to use the connection_string instead.
# This example is provided primarily for existing configurations that have not yet transitioned to the connection string.
exporters:
  azuremonitor:
    instrumentation_key: b1cd0778-85fc-4677-a3fa-79d3c23e0efd
```

Example using environment variable:

Ensure `APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING` is set in your environment, then configure the exporter without specifying a connection string or instrumentation key:

```yaml
exporters:
  azuremonitor:
```

## Attribute mapping

### Traces

This exporter maps OpenTelemetry trace data to [Application Insights data model](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/app/data-model-dependency-telemetry) using the following schema.

The OpenTelemetry SpanKind determines the Application Insights telemetry type.

| OpenTelemetry SpanKind           | Application Insights telemetry type |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `CLIENT`, `PRODUCER`, `INTERNAL` | Dependency                          |
| `SERVER`, `CONSUMER`             | Request                             |

The exporter follows the semantic conventions to fill the Application Insights specific telemetry properties. The following table shows a basic mapping.

| Application Insights property | OpenTelemetry attribute                               | Default   |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| Request.Name                  | `http.method`, `http.route` or `rpc.system`           | span name |
| Request.Url                   | `http.scheme`, `http.host`, `http.target`             |           |
| Request.Source                | `http.client_ip` or `net.peer.name`                   |           |
| Request.ResponseCode          | `http.status_code` or `status_code`                   | `"0"`     |
| Request.Success               | `http.status_code` or `status_code`                   | `true`    |
| Dependency.Name               | `http.method`, `http.route`                           | span name |
| Dependency.Data               | `http.url` or span name or `db.statement`             |           |
| Dependency.Type               | `"HTTP"` or `rpc.system` or `db.system` or `"InProc"` |           |
| Dependency.Target             | host of `http.url` or `net.peer.name`                 |           |
| Dependency.ResultCode         | `http.status_code` or `status_code`                   | `"0"`     |
| Dependency.Success            | `http.status_code` or `status_code`                   | `true`    |

The exact mapping can be found [here](trace_to_envelope.go).

All attributes are also mapped to custom properties if they are booleans or strings and to custom measurements if they are ints or doubles.

#### Span Events

Span events are optionally saved to the Application Insights `traces` table.
Exception events are saved to the Application Insights `exception` table.

### Logs

This exporter saves log records to Application Insights `traces` table.
[TraceId](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/logs/data-model.md#field-traceid) is mapped to `operation_id` column and [SpanId](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/logs/data-model.md#field-spanid) is mapped to `operation_parentId` column.

### Metrics

This exporter saves metrics to Application Insights `customMetrics` table.
