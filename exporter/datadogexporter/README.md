> Please review the Collector's [security documentation](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/main/docs/security-best-practices.md), which contains recommendations on securing sensitive information such as the API key required by this exporter.

> The Datadog Exporter now skips APM stats computation by default. It is recommended to only use the [Datadog Connector](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/connector/datadogconnector) in order to compute APM stats.
> To temporarily revert to the previous behavior, disable the `exporter.datadogexporter.DisableAPMStats` feature gate. Example: `otelcol --config=config.yaml --feature-gates=-exporter.datadogexporter.DisableAPMStats`

Find the full configs of Datadog exporter and their usage in [collector.yaml](./examples/collector.yaml). More example configs can be found in the [official documentation](https://docs.datadoghq.com/opentelemetry/setup/collector_exporter/).

## FAQs

### Why am I getting errors 413 - Request Entity Too Large, how do I fix it?

This error indicates the payload size sent by the Datadog exporter exceeds the size limit (see previous examples https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/issues/16834, https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/issues/17566).

This is usually caused by the pipeline batching too many telemetry data before sending to the Datadog exporter. To fix that, try lowering `send_batch_size` and `send_batch_max_size` in your batchprocessor config. You might want to have a separate batch processor dedicated for datadog exporter if other exporters expect a larger batch size, e.g.
```
processors:
  batch:  # To be used by other exporters
    timeout: 1s
    # Default value for send_batch_size is 8192
  batch/datadog:
    send_batch_max_size: 100
    send_batch_size: 10
    timeout: 10s
...
service:
  pipelines:
    metrics:
      receivers: ...
      processors: [batch/datadog]
      exporters: [datadog]
```

The exact values for `send_batch_size` and `send_batch_max_size` depends on your specific workload. Also note that, Datadog intake has different payload size limits for the 3 signal types:
- Trace intake: 3.2MB
- Log intake: https://docs.datadoghq.com/api/latest/logs/
- Metrics V2 intake: https://docs.datadoghq.com/api/latest/metrics/#submit-metrics

### Fall back to the Zorkian metric client with feature gate

Since [v0.69.0](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/releases/tag/v0.69.0), the Datadog exporter has switched to use the native metric client `datadog-api-client-go` for metric export instead of Zorkian client by default. While `datadog-api-client-go` fixed several issues that are present in Zorkian client, there is a performance regression with it compared to Zorkian client especially under high metric volume. If you observe memory or throughput issues in the Datadog exporter with `datadog-api-client-go`, you can configure the Datadog exporter to fall back to the Zorkian client by disabling the feature gate `exporter.datadogexporter.metricexportnativeclient`, e.g.
```
otelcol --config=config.yaml --feature-gates=-exporter.datadogexporter.metricexportnativeclient
```
Note that we are currently migrating the Datadog metrics exporter to use the metrics serializer instead. The feature flag `exporter.datadogexporter.metricexportnativeclient` will be deprecated and eventually removed in the future, following the [feature lifecycle](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/tree/main/featuregate#feature-lifecycle).

### Remap OTel’s service.name attribute to service for logs

**NOTE** this workaround is only needed when feature gate `exporter.datadogexporter.UseLogsAgentExporter` is disabled. This feature gate is enabled by default starting v0.108.0.

For Datadog Exporter versions 0.83.0 - v0.107.0, the `service` field of OTel logs is populated as [OTel semantic convention](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/resource/#service) `service.name`. However, `service.name` is not one of the default [service attributes](https://docs.datadoghq.com/logs/log_configuration/pipelines/?tab=service#service-attribute) in Datadog’s log preprocessing.

To get the service field correctly populated in your logs, you can specify service.name to be the source of a log’s service by setting a [log service remapper processor](https://docs.datadoghq.com/logs/log_configuration/pipelines/?tab=service#service-attribute).

### How to add custom log source

In order to add a custom source to your OTLP logs, set resource attribute `datadog.log.source`. This feature requires `exporter.datadogexporter.UseLogsAgentExporter` feature flag to be enabled (now enabled by default).

Example:
```
processors:
  transform/logs:
    log_statements:
      - context: resource
        statements:
          - set(attributes["datadog.log.source"], "otel")
```
