  config:
    description: Config defines configuration for retrying batches in case of receiving a retryable error from a downstream consumer. If the retryable error doesn't provide a delay, exponential backoff is applied.
    type: object
    properties:
      enabled:
        description: Enabled indicates whether to not retry sending logs in case of receiving a retryable error from a downstream consumer. Default is false.
        type: boolean
      initial_interval:
        description: InitialInterval the time to wait after the first failure before retrying. Default value is 1 second.
        type: string
        format: duration
      max_elapsed_time:
        description: MaxElapsedTime is the maximum amount of time (including retries) spent trying to send a logs batch to a downstream consumer. Once this value is reached, the data is discarded. It never stops if MaxElapsedTime == 0. Default value is 5 minutes.
        type: string
        format: duration
      max_interval:
        description: MaxInterval is the upper bound on backoff interval. Once this value is reached the delay between consecutive retries will always be `MaxInterval`. Default value is 30 seconds.
        type: string
