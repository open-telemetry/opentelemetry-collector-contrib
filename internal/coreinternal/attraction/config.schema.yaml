      action:
        description: Action specifies the type of action to perform. The set of values are {INSERT, UPDATE, UPSERT, DELETE, HASH}. Both lower case and upper case are supported. INSERT -  Inserts the key/value to attributes when the key does not exist. No action is applied to attributes where the key already exists. Either Value, FromAttribute or FromContext must be set. UPDATE -  Updates an existing key with a value. No action is applied to attributes where the key does not exist. Either Value, FromAttribute or FromContext must be set. UPSERT -  Performs insert or update action depending on the attributes containing the key. The key/value is inserted to attributes that did not originally have the key. The key/value is updated for attributes where the key already existed. Either Value, FromAttribute or FromContext must be set. DELETE  - Deletes the attribute. If the key doesn't exist, no action is performed. HASH    - Calculates the SHA-1 hash of an existing value and overwrites the value with its SHA-1 hash result. If the feature gate `coreinternal.attraction.hash.sha256` is enabled, it uses SHA2-256 instead. EXTRACT - Extracts values using a regular expression rule from the input 'key' to target keys specified in the 'rule'. If a target key already exists, it will be overridden. CONVERT  - converts the type of an existing attribute, if convertable This is a required field.

      converted_type:
        description: ConvertedType specifies the target type of an attribute to be converted If the key doesn't exist, no action is performed. If the value cannot be converted, the original value will be left as-is
        type: string
      from_attribute:
        description: FromAttribute specifies the attribute to use to populate the value. If the attribute doesn't exist, no action is performed.
        type: string
      from_context:
        description: FromContext specifies the context value to use to populate the value. The values would be searched in client.Info.Metadata. If the key doesn't exist, no action is performed. If the key has multiple values the values will be joined with `;` separator.

      key:
        description: Key specifies the attribute to act upon. This is a required field.

      pattern:
        description: 'A regex pattern must be specified for the action EXTRACT. It uses the attribute specified by `key'' to extract values from The target keys are inferred based on the names of the matcher groups provided and the names will be inferred based on the values of the matcher group. Note: All subexpressions must have a name. Note: The value type of the source key must be a string. If it isn''t, no extraction will occur.'
        type: string
      value:
        description: Value specifies the value to populate for the key. The type of the value is inferred from the configuration.
