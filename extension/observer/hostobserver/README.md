The `host_observer` looks at the current host for listening network endpoints.

It will look for all listening sockets on TCP and UDP over IPv4 and IPv6.

It uses the /proc filesystem and requires the SYS_PTRACE and DAC_READ_SEARCH capabilities so that it can determine what processes own the listening sockets.

### Configuration

#### `refresh_interval`

Determines how often to look for changes in endpoints.

default: `10s`

### Endpoint Variables

Endpoint variables exposed by this observer are as follows.

| Variable  | Description                                                                                |
|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| type      | `"port"`                                                                                     |
| name      | name of the process associated to the port                                                 |
| port      | port number                                                                                |
| command   | full command used to invoke this process, including the executable itself at the beginning |
| is_ipv6   | `true` if the endpoint is IPv6                                                             |
| transport | "TCP" or "UDP"                                                                             |
