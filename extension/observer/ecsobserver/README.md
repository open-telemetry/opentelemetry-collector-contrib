The `ecsobserver` uses the ECS/EC2 API to discover prometheus scrape targets from all running tasks and filter them
based on service names, task definitions and container labels.

NOTE: If you run collector as a sidecar, you should consider
use [ECS resource detector](../../../processor/resourcedetectionprocessor/README.md) instead. However, it does not have
service, EC2 instances etc. because it only queries local API.

## Config

The configuration is based on
[existing cloudwatch agent ECS discovery](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/ContainerInsights-Prometheus-Setup-autodiscovery-ecs.html)
. A full collector config looks like the following:

```yaml
extensions:
  ecs_observer:
    refresh_interval: 60s # format is https://golang.org/pkg/time/#ParseDuration
    cluster_name: 'Cluster-1' # cluster name need manual config
    cluster_region: 'us-west-2' # region can be configured directly or use AWS_REGION env var
    result_file: '/etc/ecs_sd_targets.yaml' # the directory for file must already exists
    services:
      - name_pattern: '^retail-.*$'
    docker_labels:
      - port_label: 'ECS_PROMETHEUS_EXPORTER_PORT'
    task_definitions:
      - job_name: 'task_def_1'
        metrics_path: '/metrics'
        metrics_ports:
          - 9113
          - 9090
        arn_pattern: '.*:task-definition/nginx:[0-9]+'

          file_sd_configs:
            - files:
                - '/etc/ecs_sd_targets.yaml' # MUST match the file name in ecs_observer.result_file
          relabel_configs: # Relabel here because label with __ prefix will be dropped by receiver.
            - source_labels: [ __meta_ecs_cluster_name ] # ClusterName
              action: replace
              target_label: ClusterName
            - source_labels: [ __meta_ecs_service_name ] # ServiceName
              action: replace
              target_label: ServiceName
            - action: labelmap # Convert docker labels on container to metric labels
              regex: ^__meta_ecs_container_labels_(.+)$ # Capture the key using regex, e.g. __meta_ecs_container_labels_Java_EMF_Metrics -> Java_EMF_Metrics
              replacement: '$$1'

### Output configuration

`result_file` specifies where to write the discovered targets. It MUST match the files defined in `file_sd_configs` for
prometheus receiver. See [output format](#output-format) for the detailed format.

### Filters configuration

There are three type of filters, and they share the following common optional properties.

- `job_name`
- `metrics_path`
- `metrics_ports` an array of port number

Example

```yaml
ecs_observer:
  job_name: 'ecs-sd-job'
  services:
    - name_pattern: ^retail-.*$
      container_name_pattern: ^java-api-v[12]$

```

#### ECS Service Name based filter Configuration

### Authentication

It uses the default credential chain, on ECS it is advised to
use  [ECS task role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/userguide/task-iam-roles.html). You need to deploy the
collector as an ECS task/service with
the [following permissions](https://docs.amazonaws.cn/en_us/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/ContainerInsights-Prometheus-install-ECS.html#ContainerInsights-Prometheus-Setup-ECS-IAM)
.

**EC2** access is required for getting private IP for ECS EC2. However, EC2 permission can be removed if you are only
using Fargate because task ip comes from awsvpc instead of host.

```text
ec2:DescribeInstances
ecs:ListTasks
ecs:ListServices
ecs:DescribeContainerInstances
ecs:DescribeServices
ecs:DescribeTasks
ecs:DescribeTaskDefinition
```

## Design

- [Discovery](#discovery-mechanism)
- [Notify receiver](#notify-prometheus-receiver-of-discovered-targets)
- [Output format](#output-format)

### Discovery mechanism

The extension polls ECS API periodically to get all running tasks and filter out scrape targets. There are 3 types of
filters for discovering targets, targets match the filter are kept. Targets from different filters are merged base
on `address/metrics_path` before updating/creating receiver.

#### ECS Service Name based filter

ECS [Service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs_services.html) is a deployment that
manages multiple tasks with same [definition](#ecs-task-definition-based-filter) (like Deployment and DaemonSet in k8s).

The `service`
configuration matches both service name and container name (if not empty).

NOTE: name of the service is **added** as label value with key `ServiceName`.

```yaml
# Example 1: Matches all containers that are started by retail-* service
name_pattern: ^retail-.*$
---
# Example 2: Matches all container with name java-api in cash-app service 
name_pattnern: ^cash-app$
container_name_pattern: ^java-api$
---
# Example 3: Override default metrics_path (i.e. /metrics)
name_pattern: ^log-replay-worker$
metrics_path: /v3/metrics
```

### ECS Task Definition based filter

ECS [task definition](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task_definitions.html) contains one or
more containers (like Pod in k8s). Long running applications normally uses [service](#ecs-service-name-based-filter).
while short running (batch) jobs can
be [created from task definitions directly](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/scheduling_tasks.html)
.

The `task` definition matches both task definition name and container name (of not empty). Optional config
like `metrics_path`, `metrics_ports`, `job_name` can override default value.

```yaml
# Example 1: Matches all the tasks created from task definition that contains memcached in its arn
arn_pattern: "*memcached.*"
```

### Docker Label based filter

Docker label can be specified in task definition. Only `port_label` is used when checking if the container should be
included. Optional config like `metrics_path_label`, `job_name_label` can override default value.

```yaml
# Example 1: Matches all the container that has label ECS_PROMETHEUS_EXPORTER_PORT_NGINX
port_label: 'ECS_PROMETHEUS_EXPORTER_PORT_NGINX'
---
# Example 2: Override job name based on label MY_APP_JOB_NAME
port_label: 'ECS_PROMETHEUS_EXPORTER_PORT_MY_APP'
job_name_label: 'MY_APP_JOB_NAME'
```

### Notify Prometheus Receiver of discovered targets

There are three ways to notify a receiver

- Use [file based service discovery](#generate-target-file-for-file-based-discovery) in prometheus config and updates
  the file.
- Use [receiver creator framework](#receiver-creator-framework) to create a new receiver for new endpoints.
- Register as a prometheus discovery plugin.

#### Generate target file for file based discovery

- Status: implemented

This is current approach used by cloudwatch-agent and
also [recommended by prometheus](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#file_sd_config)
. It's easier to debug and the main drawback is it only works for prometheus. Another minor issue is fsnotify may not
work properly occasionally and delay the update.

#### Receiver creator framework

- Status: pending

This is a generic approach that creates a new receiver at runtime based on discovered endpoints. The main problem is
performance issue as described
in [this issue](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/issues/1395).

#### Register as prometheus discovery plugin

- Status: pending

Because both the collector and prometheus is written in Go, we can call `discover.RegisterConfig` to make it a valid
config for prometheus (like other in tree plugins like kubernetes). The drawback is the configuration is now under
prometheus instead of extension and can cause confusion.

## Output Format

[Example in unit test](testdata/ut_targets.expected.yaml).

The format is based
on [cloudwatch agent](https://github.com/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/tree/master/internal/ecsservicediscovery#example-result)
, [ec2 sd](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#ec2_sd_config)
and [kubernetes sd](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#kubernetes_sd_config).
Task and labels from task definition are always included. EC2 info is only included when task is running on ECS EC2 (
i.e. not on [Fargate](https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/)).

Unlike cloudwatch agent, all the [additional labels](#additional-labels) starts with `__meta_ecs_` prefix. If they are
not renamed during [relabel](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#relabel_config),
they will all get dropped in prometheus receiver and won't pass down along the pipeline.

The number of dimensions supported by [AWS EMF exporter](../../../exporter/awsemfexporter) is limited by its backend.
The labels can be modified/filtered at different stages, prometheus receiver
relabel, [Metrics Transform Processor](../../../processor/metricstransformprocessor)
and [EMF exporter Metric Declaration](../../../exporter/awsemfexporter/README.md#metric_declaration)

### Essential Labels

### Serialization

- Labels, all the label value are encoded as string. (e.g. strconv.Itoa(123)).
- Go struct, all the non string types are converted. labels and tags are passed as `map[string]string`
  instead of `[]KeyValue`
- Prometheus target, each `taget`

```go
// PrometheusECSTarget contains address and labels extracted from a running ECS task 
// and its underlying EC2 instance (if available).
// 
// For serialization
// - FromLabels and ToLabels converts it between map[string]string.
// - FromTargetYAML and ToTargetYAML converts it between prometheus file discovery format in YAML. 
// - FromTargetJSON and ToTargetJSON converts it between prometheus file discovery format in JSON.

	Address                string            `json:"address"`

### Delta

Delta is **not** supported because there is no watch API in ECS (unlike k8s, see [known issues](#known-issues)). The
output always contains all the targets. Caller/Consumer need to implement their own logic to calculate the targets diff
if they only want to process new targets.

## Known issues

- There is no list watch API in ECS (unlike k8s), and we fetch ALL the tasks and filter it locally. If the poll interval
  is too short or there are multiple instances doing discovery, you may hit the (undocumented) API rate limit. In memory
  caching is implemented to reduce calls for task definition and ec2.
- A single collector may not be able to handle a large cluster, you can use `hashmod`
  in [relabel_config](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#relabel_config) to do
  static sharding. However, too many collectors may trigger the rate limit on AWS API as each shard is fetching ALL the
  tasks during discovery regardless of number of shards.

## Implementation

The implementation has two parts, core ecs service discovery logic and adapter for notifying discovery results.

### Packages

- `extension/observer/ecsobserver` main logic
- [internal/ecsmock](internal/ecsmock) mock ECS cluster
- [internal/errctx](internal/errctx) structured error wrapping

### Flow

The pseudocode showing the overall flow.

```
NewECSSD() {
  session := awsconfig.NewSssion()
  ecsClient := awsecs.NewClient(session)
  filters := config.NewFileters()
  decorator := awsec2.NewClient(session)
  for {
    select {
    case <- timer:
      // Fetch ALL
      tasks := ecsClient.FaetchAll()
      // Filter
      filteredTasks := fileters.Apply(tasks)
      // Add EC2 info
      decorator.Apply(filteredTask)
      // Generate output
      if writeResultFile {
         writeFile(fileteredTasks, /etc/ecs_sd.yaml)
      } else {
          notifyObserver()
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Metrics

Following metrics are logged at debug level. TODO(pingleig): Is there a way for otel plugins to export custom metrics to
otel's own /metrics.

### Error Handling

- Auth and cluster not found error will cause the extension to stop (calling `host.ReportFatalError`). Although IAM role
  can be updated at runtime without restarting the collector, it's better to fail to make the problem obvious. Same
  applies to cluster not found. In the future we can add config to downgrade those errors if user want to monitor an ECS
  cluster with collector running outside the cluster, the collector can run anywhere as long as it can reach scrape
  targets and AWS API.
- If we have non-critical error, we overwrite existing file with whatever targets we have, we might not have all the
  targets due to throttle etc.

### Unit Test

A mock ECS and EC2 server is in [internal/ecsmock](internal/ecsmock), see [fetcher_test](fetcher_test.go) for its usage.

### Integration Test

Will be implemented in [AOT Testing Framework](https://github.com/aws-observability/aws-otel-test-framework) to run
against actual ECS service on both EC2 and Fargate.
