The Docker observer extension is a [Receiver Creator](../../../receiver/receivercreator/README.md)-compatible "watch observer" that will detect and report
container endpoints discovered through the Docker API. Only containers that are in the state of `Running` and not `Paused` will emit endpoints.
This observer watches the Docker engine's stream of events to dynamically create, update, and remove endpoints as events are processed.

Requires Docker API Version 1.24+.

The collector will need permissions to access the Docker Engine API, specifically it will need
read access to the Docker socket (default `unix:///var/run/docker.sock` on non-Windows and `npipe:////./pipe/docker_engine` on Windows).


## Example Config

```yaml
extensions:
  docker_observer:
    # url of the docker socket, defaults to unix:///var/run/docker.sock on non-Windows and npipe:////./pipe/docker_engine on Windows
    endpoint: my/path/to/docker.sock
    # list of container image names to exclude
    excluded_images: ['redis', 'another_image_name']
    # client API version, default to 1.24
    api_version: "1.25"
    # max amount of time to wait for a response from Docker API , default to 5s
    timeout: 15s

receivers:
  receiver_creator:
    watch_observers: [docker_observer]
    receivers:
      nginx:
        rule: type == "container" and name matches "nginx" and port == 80
        config:
          endpoint: '`endpoint`/status'
          collection_interval: 10s
```

## Configuration

### `endpoint`

The URL of the docker server.

default: `unix:///var/run/docker.sock` on non-Windows and `npipe:////./pipe/docker_engine` on Windows

### `timeout`

The maximum amount of time to wait for docker API responses.

default: `5s`

### `api_version`

The client API version. Make sure you input it as a string instead of a float (e.g. `"1.4"` instead of `1.4`).

default: `"1.24"`

### `excluded_images`

A list of filters whose matching images are to be excluded. Supports literals, globs, and regex.

default: `[]`

### `use_hostname_if_present`

If true, the `Config.Hostname` field (if present) of the docker
container will be used as the discovered host that is used to configure
receivers.  If false or if no hostname is configured, the field
`NetworkSettings.IPAddress` is used instead. These settings can be found
in the output of the Docker API's [Container Inspect](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.41/#operation/ContainerInspect) json.

default: `false`

### `use_host_bindings`

If true, the observer will configure receivers for matching container endpoints
using the host bound ip and port.  This is useful if containers exist that are not
accessible to an instance of the collector running outside of the docker network stack.

default: `false`

### `ignore_non_host_bindings`

If true, the observer will ignore discovered container endpoints that are not bound
to host ports.  This is useful if containers exist that are not accessible
to an instance of the collector running outside of the docker network stack.

default: `false`

### `cache_sync_interval`

The time to wait before resyncing the list of containers the observer maintains
through the docker event listener example: `cache_sync_interval: "20m"`

default: `60m`

## Endpoint Variables

The following endpoint variables are exposed to the receiver creator to be used in discovery rules:

| Variable | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| name | string | Primary name of the container |
| image | string | Name of the container image |
| port | uint16 | Exposed port of the container |
| alternate_port | uint16 | Exposed port accessed through redirection, such as a mapped port |
| command | string | The command used to invoke the process of the container |
| container_id | string | ID of the container |
| host | string | Hostname or IP of the underlying host the container is running on |
| transport | string | Transport protocol used by the endpoint (TCP or UDP) |
| labels | map[string]string | User-specified metadata labels on the container |
