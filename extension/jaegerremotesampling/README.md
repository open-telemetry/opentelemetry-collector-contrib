This extension allows serving sampling strategies following the Jaeger's remote sampling API. This extension can be configured to proxy requests to a backing remote sampling server, which could potentially be a Jaeger Collector down the pipeline, or a static JSON file from the local file system.

By default, two listeners are made available:
- `localhost:5778`, following the legacy remote sampling endpoint as defined by Jaeger
- `localhost:14250`, following the gRPC remote sampling endpoint, also defined by Jaeger

Note that the port `14250` will clash with the Jaeger Receiver. When both are used, it's recommended to change this extension to use another port.

Although this extension is derived from Jaeger, it can be used by any clients who can consume this standard, such as the [OpenTelemetry Java SDK](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java/tree/v1.9.1/sdk-extensions/jaeger-remote-sampler).

At this moment, the `reload_interval` option is only effective for the `file` source. In the future, this property will be used to control a local cache for a `remote` source.

The `file` source can be used to load files from the local file system or from remote HTTP/S sources. The `remote` source must be used with a gRPC server that provides a Jaeger remote sampling service.

## Configuration

```yaml
extensions:
  jaegerremotesampling:
    source:
      remote:
        endpoint: jaeger-collector:14250
  jaegerremotesampling/1:
    source:
      reload_interval: 1s
      file: /etc/otelcol/sampling_strategies.json
  jaegerremotesampling/2:
    source:
      reload_interval: 1s
      file: http://jaeger.example.com/sampling_strategies.json
```

A sampling strategy file could look like:

```json
{
  "service_strategies": [
    {
      "service": "foo",
      "type": "probabilistic",
      "param": 0.8,
      "operation_strategies": [
        {
          "operation": "op1",
          "type": "probabilistic",
          "param": 0.2
        },
        {
          "operation": "op2",
          "type": "probabilistic",
          "param": 0.4
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "service": "bar",
      "type": "ratelimiting",
      "param": 5
    }
  ],
  "default_strategy": {
    "type": "probabilistic",
    "param": 0.5,
    "operation_strategies": [
      {
        "operation": "/health",
        "type": "probabilistic",
        "param": 0.0
      },
      {
        "operation": "/metrics",
        "type": "probabilistic",
        "param": 0.0
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
