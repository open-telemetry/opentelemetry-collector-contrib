This extension implements both `configauth.ServerAuthenticator` and `configauth.ClientAuthenticator` to authenticate clients and servers using Basic Authentication. The authenticator type has to be set to `basicauth`.

When used as ServerAuthenticator, if the authentication is successful `client.Info.Auth` will expose the following attributes:

- `username`: The username of the authenticated user.
- `raw`: Raw base64 encoded credentials.

The configuration should specify only one instance of `basicauth` extension for either client or server authentication. 

The following are the configuration options:

- `htpasswd.file`:  The path to the htpasswd file.
- `htpasswd.inline`: The htpasswd file inline content.
- `client_auth.username`: Username to use for client authentication.
- `client_auth.password`: Password to use for client authentication.

To configure the extension as a server authenticator, either one of `htpasswd.file` or `htpasswd.inline` has to be set. If both are configured, `htpasswd.inline` credentials take precedence.

To configure the extension as a client authenticator, `client_auth` has to be set.

If both the options are configured, the extension will throw an error.
