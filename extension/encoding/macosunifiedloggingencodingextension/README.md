The `macos_unified_logging_encoding` extension is an encoding extension that can unmarshal macOS Unified Logging binary data.

This extension reads binary tracev3 files from macOS Unified Logging archives and converts them into OpenTelemetry log records. It is designed to work with the macOS Unified Logging receiver.

## Configuration

Here is the default configuration:
```yaml
extensions:
  macos_unified_logging_encoding:
    debug_mode: false
```

### Configuration Parameters

- `debug_mode` (default: `false`): Enables additional debug information during decoding, including hex dumps of binary data.

## Features

- Reads binary macOS Unified Logging data (tracev3 format)
- Converts binary data to structured OpenTelemetry log records
- Provides debug mode for troubleshooting binary data issues
- Currently in alpha - basic binary reading implemented, full decoding in progress

## Usage

This extension is typically used with the macOS Unified Logging receiver to process system logs on macOS platforms.

```yaml
receivers:
  macosunifiedlog:
    # receiver configuration

extensions:
  macos_unified_logging_encoding:
    debug_mode: false

service:
  extensions: [macos_unified_logging_encoding]
  pipelines:
    logs:
      receivers: [macosunifiedlog]
      # other pipeline components
```
