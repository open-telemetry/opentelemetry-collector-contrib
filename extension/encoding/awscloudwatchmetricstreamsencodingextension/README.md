This extension unmarshals metrics encoded in formats produced by
[Amazon CloudWatch Metric Streams](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-Metric-Streams.html).

The extension can be configured to unmarshal metrics in either the JSON or OpenTelemetry 1.0.0 output formats.
At this time the OpenTelemetry 0.7.0 output format is unsupported, there are no plans to add support for it.

Example for OpenTelemetry 1.0.0 format:
```yaml
extensions:
  awscloudwatchmetricstreams_encoding:
    format: opentelemetry1.0
```

Example for JSON format:
```yaml
extensions:
  awscloudwatchmetricstreams_encoding:
    format: json
```
