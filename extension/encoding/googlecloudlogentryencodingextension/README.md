This extension can be used fo unmarshaling a [Cloud Logging] [LogEntry] message type.

The following configuration options are supported:

* `handle_json_payload_as` (Optional): This controls how the json payload of the [LogEntry]  is parsed into the body.
  The default `json` parses it as standard JSON, while `text` will the put the payload as a single string.
* `handle_proto_payload_as` (Optional): This controls how the json payload of the [LogEntry]  is parsed into the body. 
  The default `json` parses it as standard JSON, while `proto` will use the well known protobuf types used in a
  [LogEntry] providing a better type handling, but sacrificing stability. Using `text` will the put the payload as a
  single string.

The encoding is mainly used in conjunction with the `googlecloudpubsubreceiver`. The receiver can be used to bring 
Cloud Logging messages into an OpenTelemetry pipeline. You'll first need to [set up a logging sink][sink-docs] with 
a Pub/Sub topic as its destination. This encoder can be configure to parse the [LogEntry]. An example config
could look like this:

```yaml
extensions:
  googlecloudlogentry_encoding:
    handle_json_payload_as: "json"
    handle_proto_payload_as: "json"

receivers:
  googlecloudpubsub:
    project: otel-project
    subscription: projects/otel-project/subscriptions/otlp-logs
    encoding: googlecloudlogentry_encoding
```
Google Cloud logging uses the [LogEntry] to carry log information. In this section, the mapping of the fields to
OpenTelemetry fields and attributes are documented.

## Semantic Mapping

Some of the attributes can be moved to OpenTelemetry Semantic Conventions. Note, however, that all the attributes are
considered experimental and are subject to change.

| Field       | Type      | Description                            | Maps to Unified Model Field    |
|-------------|-----------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| `insert_id` | `boolean` | A unique identifier for the log entry. | `Attributes["log.record.uid"]` |

## Attribute and Field mapping

The rest of the JSON body is either mapped to attributes with a `gcp` prefix or directly mapped to the LogRecord.

| Field              | Type                     | Description                                                                                                      | Maps to Unified Model Field                   |

## Severity Mapping

The severity is mapping from [Google Cloud Log Severity] to the OpenTelemetry Severity Number.

|------------------|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `DEFAULT`(0)     | `UNSPECIFIED`(0) | The log entry has no assigned severity level.                                          |
| `DEBUG`(100)     | `DEBUG`(5)       | Debug or trace information.                                                            |
| `INFO`(200)      | `INFO`(9)        | Routine information, such as ongoing status or performance.                            |

| `WARNING`(400)   | `WARN`(13)       | Warning events might cause problems.                                                   |
| `ERROR`(500)     | `ERROR`(17)      | Error events are likely to cause problems.                                             |
| `CRITICAL`(600)  | `FATAL`(21)      | Critical events cause more severe problems or outages.                                 |
