This extension implements a `configauth.ServerAuthenticator`, to be used in receivers inside the `auth` settings. The authenticator type has to be set to `oidc`.

## Configuration

```yaml
extensions:
  oidc:
    providers:
      - issuer_url: http://localhost:8080/auth/realms/opentelemetry
        issuer_ca_path: /etc/pki/tls/cert.pem
        audience: account
        username_claim: email

receivers:
  otlp:
    protocols:
      grpc:
        auth:
          authenticator: oidc

processors:

exporters:
  debug:
    verbosity: detailed

service:
  extensions: [oidc]
  pipelines:
    traces:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: []
      exporters: [debug]
```

## Provider Matching

Although multiple OIDC providers can be configured, incoming tokens will only be verified against a single provider. This is done by decoding the token, extracting the `iss` claim, and checking the configured providers for one with a matching `issuer_url` field.

If no matching `issuer_url` is found, the extension will fail to authenticate with an error informing the caller that `no OIDC provider configured for the issuer`.

## Configuration Structure Change

Earlier versions of this extension only allowed configuring a single provider:
```yaml
extensions:
  oidc:
    issuer_url: http://localhost:8080/auth/realms/opentelemetry
    issuer_ca_path: /etc/pki/tls/cert.pem
```

Although this configuration is still accepted by the extension, it is deprecated and support for it will be dropped in the future.
