# Health Check

> ⚠️⚠️⚠️ **Warning** ⚠️⚠️⚠️
>
> The `check_collector_pipeline` feature of this extension is not working as expected. It
> is recommended to not use the feature. The work to add a new version of the healthcheck extension
> that relies on individual component status is in progress. To avoid breaking backwards compatibility,
> the configuration will not be changed until the new extension is available as a replacement for this
> one. See https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/issues/11780 for more
> details.

Health Check extension enables an HTTP url that can be probed to check the
status of the OpenTelemetry Collector. This extension can be used as a
liveness and/or readiness probe on Kubernetes.

The following settings are available:

- `endpoint` (default = localhost:13133): Address to publish the health check status. You can review the [full list of `ServerConfig`](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/tree/main/config/confighttp). See our [security best practices doc](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/security/config-best-practices/#protect-against-denial-of-service-attacks) to understand how to set the endpoint in different environments.
- `path` (default = "/"): Specifies the path to be configured for the health check server.
- `response_body` (default = `{}`): Specifies a static body that overrides the default response returned by the health check service.
  - `response_body::healthy`: Specifies the body returned when service is healthy.
  - `response_body::unhealthy`: Specifies the body returned when service is unhealthy.

Example:

```yaml
extensions:
  health_check:
  health_check/1:
    endpoint: "localhost:13"
    tls:
      ca_file: "/path/to/ca.crt"
      cert_file: "/path/to/cert.crt"
      key_file: "/path/to/key.key"
    path: "/health/status"
    response_body:
      healthy: I'm good
      unhealthy: I'm bad!
```

The full list of settings exposed for this exporter is documented in [config.go](./config.go)
with detailed sample configurations in [testdata/config.yaml](./testdata/config.yaml).
