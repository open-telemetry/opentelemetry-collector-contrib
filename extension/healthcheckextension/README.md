# Health Check

> ⚠️⚠️⚠️ **Warning** ⚠️⚠️⚠️
>
> The `check_collector_pipeline` feature of this extension is not working as expected. It
> is recommended to not use the feature. The work to add a new version of the healthcheck extension
> that relies on individual component status is in progress. To avoid breaking backwards compatibility,
> the configuration will not be changed until the new extension is available as a replacement for this
> one. See https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/issues/11780 for more
> details.

Health Check extension enables an HTTP url that can be probed to check the
status of the OpenTelemetry Collector. This extension can be used as a
liveness and/or readiness probe on Kubernetes.

The following settings are required:

- `endpoint` (default = localhost:13133): Address to publish the health check status. For full list of `ServerConfig` refer [here](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/tree/main/config/confighttp). You can temporarily disable the `component.UseLocalHostAsDefaultHost` feature gate to change this to 0.0.0.0:13133. This feature gate will be removed in a future release.
- `path` (default = "/"): Specifies the path to be configured for the health check server.
- `response_body` (default = ""): Specifies a static body that overrides the default response returned by the health check service. 

Example:

```yaml
extensions:
  health_check:
  health_check/1:
    endpoint: "localhost:13"
    tls:
      ca_file: "/path/to/ca.crt"
      cert_file: "/path/to/cert.crt"
      key_file: "/path/to/key.key"
    path: "/health/status"
```

The full list of settings exposed for this exporter is documented [here](./config.go)
with detailed sample configurations [here](./testdata/config.yaml).
