> ℹ️ **Migration Notice** ℹ️
>
> This extension is migrating to use component status reporting for health checks
> while maintaining full backward compatibility. See the [Backward Compatibility](#backward-compatibility)
> section for details about feature gates and migration options.

> ⚠️⚠️⚠️ **Warning** ⚠️⚠️⚠️
>
> The `check_collector_pipeline` feature of this extension is not working as expected. It
> is recommended to not use the feature. The work to add a new version of the healthcheck extension
> that relies on individual component status is in progress. To avoid breaking backwards compatibility,
> the configuration will not be changed until the new extension is available as a replacement for this
> one. See https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/issues/11780 for more

Health Check extension enables an HTTP url that can be probed to check the
status of the OpenTelemetry Collector. This extension can be used as a
liveness and/or readiness probe on Kubernetes.

The following settings are available:

- `endpoint` (default = localhost:13133): Address to publish the health check status. You can review the [full list of `ServerConfig`](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/tree/main/config/confighttp). See our [security best practices doc](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/security/config-best-practices/#protect-against-denial-of-service-attacks) to understand how to set the endpoint in different environments.
- `path` (default = "/"): Specifies the path to be configured for the health check server.
- `response_body` (default = `{}`): Specifies a static body that overrides the default response returned by the health check service.
  - `response_body::healthy`: Specifies the body returned when service is healthy.
  - `response_body::unhealthy`: Specifies the body returned when service is unhealthy.

Example:

```yaml
extensions:
  health_check:
  health_check/1:
    endpoint: "localhost:13"
    tls:
      ca_file: "/path/to/ca.crt"
      cert_file: "/path/to/cert.crt"
      key_file: "/path/to/key.key"
    path: "/health/status"
    response_body:
      healthy: I'm good
      unhealthy: I'm bad!
```

The full list of settings exposed for this exporter is documented in [LegacyConfig in config.go](../../internal/healthcheck/internal/http/config.go#L24)
with detailed sample configurations in [testdata/config.yaml](./testdata/config.yaml).

## Backward Compatibility

[Linked issue](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/issues/42256).

This extension maintains full backward compatibility with the original Ready/NotReady behavior by keeping the legacy implementation active unless a feature gate is enabled.

### Feature Gate: `extension.healthcheck.useComponentStatus`

- **Default**: Disabled (false)
- **Purpose**: Switches the extension to the shared healthcheck implementation that reports status from component events
- **When enabled**: Health status is determined by component status events (v2 behavior)
- **When disabled**: Ready/NotReady calls directly control health endpoint status using the legacy implementation

#### Usage

To use the new event-driven behavior:

```bash
# Set the feature gate to true
--feature-gates=+extension.healthcheck.useComponentStatus
```

#### Migration Timeline

1. **Current**: Compatibility wrapper enabled by default - no breaking changes.
2. **Future**: Feature gate will be removed, compatibility wrapper will be permanently disabled.
3. **Recommended**: Test your setup with the feature gate enabled to prepare for future versions.

#### Ready/NotReady Behavior

**Legacy Implementation (Default)**
- `Ready()` → Health endpoint returns 200 OK
- `NotReady()` → Health endpoint returns 503 Service Unavailable
- Behavior identical to original extension

**Shared Healthcheck Implementation (Feature gate enabled)**
- `Ready()`/`NotReady()` → Used for pipeline lifecycle only
- Health status determined by component status events
- Behavior similar to healthcheckv2extension
