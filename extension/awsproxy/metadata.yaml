display_name: AWS Proxy Extension
type: awsproxy

description: |
  The AWS proxy accepts requests without any authentication of AWS signatures applied and forwards them to the
  AWS API, applying authentication and signing. This allows applications to avoid needing AWS credentials to access
  a service, instead configuring the AWS exporter and/or proxy in the OpenTelemetry collector and only providing the
  collector with credentials.
