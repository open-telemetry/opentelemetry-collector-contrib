This extension implements  both `configauth.ServerAuthenticator` and `configauth.ClientAuthenticator`. It can be used in both http and gRPC exporters inside the `auth` settings, as a means to embed a static token for every RPC call that will be made.

The authenticator type has to be set to `bearertokenauth`.

## Configuration

- `scheme`: Specifies the auth scheme name. Defaults to "Bearer". Optional.

- `token`: Static authorization token that needs to be sent on every gRPC client call as metadata.

- `filename`: Name of file that contains a authorization token that needs to be sent in every client call.

Either one of `token` or `filename` field is required. If both are specified, then the `token` field value is **ignored**. In any case, the value of the token will be prepended by `${scheme}` before being sent as a value of "authorization" key in the request header in case of HTTP and metadata in case of gRPC.

**Note**: bearertokenauth requires transport layer security enabled on the exporter.
