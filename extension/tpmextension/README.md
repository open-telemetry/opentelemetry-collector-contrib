## Overview

The Trusted Platform Module (TPM) extension retrieves TLS certificates from the TPM device.

The extension implements  `extensionauth.HTTPClient` interface therefore it can be used only with HTTP exporters (e.g. otlphttp exporter).

## Configuration

* `path` (required): The path to the TPM device. For example, `/dev/tpmrm0`.
* `key_file` (required): The path to the client TSS2 private key file.
* `cert_file` (required): The path to the client certificate file.
* `ca_file` (required): The path to the CA certificate file.
* `server_name_override` (optional): The server name override for the TLS connection. This is useful when the server name does not match the certificate.
* `owner_auth` (optional): The owner authorization password for the TPM device. This is required if the TPM device is protected by a password.
* `auth` (optional): The password for the TPM device. This is required if the TPM device is protected by a password.

Example:

```yaml
extensions:
  tpm:
    path: /dev/tpmrm0
    key_file: client_key.key
    cert_file: server.crt
    ca_file: ca.crt
    server_name_override: example.com
    owner_auth: tpm-password
    auth: password
```
