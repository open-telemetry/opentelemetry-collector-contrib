# Health Check Extension V2

This is an experimental extension that is intended to replace the existing
health check extension. As the stability level is currently development, users
wishing to experiment with this extension will have to build a custom collector
binary using the [OpenTelemetry Collector Builder](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/tree/main/cmd/builder).
Health check extension V2 has new functionality that can be opted-in to, and
also supports original healthcheck extension functionality with the exception
of the `check_collector_pipeline` feature. See the warning below.

> ⚠️⚠️⚠️ **Warning** ⚠️⚠️⚠️
>
> The `check_collector_pipeline` feature of this extension was not working as expected and has been
> removed. The config remains for backwards compatibility, but it too will be removed in the future.
> Users wishing to monitor pipeline health should use the v2 functionality described below and
> opt-in to component health as described in
> [component health configuration](#component-health-config).

## V1

Health Check Extension V1 enables an HTTP url that can be probed to check the
status of the OpenTelemetry Collector. This extension can be used as a
liveness and/or readiness probe on Kubernetes.

The following settings are required:

- `endpoint` (default = localhost:13133): Address to publish the health check status. For full list of `ServerConfig` refer [here](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/tree/main/config/confighttp). You can temporarily disable the `component.UseLocalHostAsDefaultHost` feature gate to change this to 0.0.0.0:13133. This feature gate will be removed in a future release.
- `path` (default = "/"): Specifies the path to be configured for the health check server.
- `response_body` (default = ""): Specifies a static body that overrides the default response returned by the health check service.
- `check_collector_pipeline:` (deprecated and ignored): Settings of collector pipeline health check
    - `enabled` (default = false): Whether enable collector pipeline check or not
    - `interval` (default = "5m"): Time interval to check the number of failures
    - `exporter_failure_threshold` (default = 5): The failure number threshold to mark
      containers as healthy.

Example:

```yaml
extensions:
  health_check:
  health_check/1:
    endpoint: "localhost:13"
    tls:
      ca_file: "/path/to/ca.crt"
      cert_file: "/path/to/cert.crt"
      key_file: "/path/to/key.key"
    path: "/health/status"
```

## V2

Health Check Extension - V2 provides HTTP and gRPC healthcheck services. The services can be used
separately or together depending on your needs. The source of health for both services is component
status reporting, a collector feature, that allows individual components to report their health via
`StatusEvent`s. The health check extension aggregates the component `StatusEvent`s into overall
collector health and pipeline health and exposes this data through its services.

Below is a table enumerating component statuses and their meanings. These will be mapped to
appropriate status codes for the protocol.

| Status            | Meaning                                                                |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Starting          | The component is starting.                                             |
| OK                | The component is running without issue.                                |
| RecoverableError  | The component has experienced a transient error and may recover.       |
| PermanentError    | The component has detected a condition at runtime that will need human intervention to fix. The collector will continue to run in a degraded mode. |
| FatalError        | The collector has experienced a fatal runtime error and will shutdown. |
| Stopping          | The component is in the process of shutting down.                      |
| Stopped           | The component has completed shutdown.                                  |

Note: Adoption of status reporting by collector components is still a work in progress. The accuracy
of this extension will improve as more components participate.

### Configuration

Below is sample configuration for both the HTTP and gRPC services with component health opt-in.
Note, the `use_v2: true` setting is necessary during the interim while V1 functionality is
incrementally phased out.

```yaml
extensions:
  healthcheckv2:
    use_v2: true
    component_health:
      include_permanent_errors: false
      include_recoverable_errors: true
      recovery_duration: 5m
    http:
      endpoint: "localhost:13133"
      status:
        enabled: true
        path: "/health/status"
      config:
        enabled: true
        path: "/health/config"
    grpc:
      endpoint: "localhost:13132"
      transport: "tcp"
```

#### Component Health Config

By default the Health Check Extension will not consider component error statuses as unhealthy. That
is, an error status will not be reflected in the response code of the health check, but it will be
available in the response body regardless of configuration. This behavior can be changed by opting
in to include recoverable and / or permanent errors.

##### `include_permanent_errors`

To opt-in to permanent errors set `include_permanent_errors: true`. When true, a permanent error
will result in a non-ok return status. By definition, this is a permanent state, and one that will
require human intervention to fix. The collector is running, albeit in a degraded state, and
restarting is unlikely to fix the problem. Thus, caution should be used when enabling this setting
while using the extension as a liveness or readiness probe in k8s.

##### `include_recoverable_errors` and `recovery_duration`

To opt-in recoverable errors set `include_recoverable_errors: true`. This setting works in tandem
with the `recovery_duration` option. When true, the Health Check Extension will consider a
recoverable error to be healthy until the recovery duration elapses, and unhealthy afterwards.
During the recovery duration an ok status will be returned. If the collector does not recover in
that time, a non-ok status will be returned. If the collector subsequently recovers, it will resume
reporting an ok status.

### HTTP Service

#### Status Endpoint

The HTTP service provides a status endpoint that can be probed for overall collector status and
per-pipeline status. The endpoint is located at `/status` by default, but can be configured using
the `http.status.path` setting. Requests to `/status` will return the overall collector status. To
probe pipeline status, pass the pipeline name as a query parameter, e.g. `/status?pipeline=traces`.
The HTTP status code returned maps to the overall collector or pipeline status, with the mapping
described below.

⚠️ Take care not to expose this endpoint on non-localhost ports as it contains the internal state
of the running collector.

##### Mapping of Component Status to HTTP Status

Component statuses are aggregated into overall collector status and overall pipeline status. In each
case, you can consider the aggregated status to be the sum of its parts. The mapping from component
status to HTTP status is as follows:

| Status            | HTTP Status Code                                         |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Starting          | 503 - Service Unavailable                                |
| OK                | 200 - OK                                                 |
| RecoverableError  | 200 - OK<sup>1</sup>                                     |
| PermanentError    | 200 - OK<sup>2</sup>                                     |
| FatalError        | 500 - Internal Server Error                              |
| Stopping          | 503 - Service Unavailable                                |
| Stopped           | 503 - Service Unavailable                                |

1. If `include_recoverable_errors: true`: 200 when elapsed time < recovery duration; 500 otherwise
2. If `include_permanent_errors: true`: 500 - Internal Server Error

##### Response Body

The response body contains either a detailed, or non-detailed view into collector or pipeline health
in JSON format. The level of detail applies to the contents of the response body and is controlled
by passing `verbose` as a query parameter.

###### Error Precedence

The response body contains either a partial or complete aggregate status in JSON format. The
aggregation process functions similar to a priority queue, where the most relevant status bubbles
to the top. By default, FatalError > PermanentError > RecoverableError, however, the priority of
RecoverableError and PermanentError will be reversed if `include_permanent_errors` is `false` and
`include_recoverable_errors` is `true` as this configuration makes RecoverableErrors more
relevant.

###### Collector Health

The detailed response body for collector health will include the overall status for the
collector, the overall status for each pipeline in the collector, and the statuses for the
individual components in each pipeline. The non-detailed response will only contain the overall
collector health.

**Verbose Example**

Assuming the health check extension is configured with `http.status.endpoint` set to
`localhost:13133` a request to `http://localhost:13133/status?verbose` will have a
response body such as:

```json
{
    "start_time": "2024-01-18T17:27:12.570394-08:00",
    "healthy": true,
    "status": "StatusRecoverableError",
    "error": "rpc error: code = ResourceExhausted desc = resource exhausted",
    "status_time": "2024-01-18T17:27:32.572301-08:00",
    "components": {
        "extensions": {
            "healthy": true,
            "status": "StatusOK",
            "status_time": "2024-01-18T17:27:12.570428-08:00",
            "components": {
                "extension:healthcheckv2": {
                    "healthy": true,
                    "status": "StatusOK",
                    "status_time": "2024-01-18T17:27:12.570428-08:00"
                }
            }
        },
        "pipeline:metrics/grpc": {
            "healthy": true,
            "status": "StatusRecoverableError",
            "error": "rpc error: code = ResourceExhausted desc = resource exhausted",
            "status_time": "2024-01-18T17:27:32.572301-08:00",
            "components": {
                "exporter:otlp/staging": {
                    "healthy": true,
                    "status": "StatusRecoverableError",
                    "error": "rpc error: code = ResourceExhausted desc = resource exhausted",
                    "status_time": "2024-01-18T17:27:32.572301-08:00"
                },
                "processor:batch": {
                    "healthy": true,
                    "status": "StatusOK",
                    "status_time": "2024-01-18T17:27:12.571132-08:00"
                },
                "receiver:otlp": {
                    "healthy": true,
                    "status": "StatusOK",
                    "status_time": "2024-01-18T17:27:12.571576-08:00"
                }
            }
        },
        "pipeline:traces/http": {
            "healthy": true,
            "status": "StatusOK",
            "status_time": "2024-01-18T17:27:12.571625-08:00",
            "components": {
                "exporter:otlphttp/staging": {
                    "healthy": true,
                    "status": "StatusOK",
                    "status_time": "2024-01-18T17:27:12.571615-08:00"
                },
                "processor:batch": {
                    "healthy": true,
                    "status": "StatusOK",
                    "status_time": "2024-01-18T17:27:12.571621-08:00"
                },
                "receiver:otlp": {
                    "healthy": true,
                    "status": "StatusOK",
                    "status_time": "2024-01-18T17:27:12.571625-08:00"
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Note the following based on this response:
- The overall status is `StatusRecoverableError` but the status healthy because `include_recoverable_errors`
  is set to `false` or it is `true` and the recovery duration has not yet passed.
- `pipeline:metrics/grpc` has a matching status, as does `exporter:otlp/staging`. This implicates
  the exporter as the root cause for the pipeline and overall collector status.
- `pipeline:traces/http` is completely healthy.

**Non-verbose Response example**

If the same request is made to a collector without setting the verbose flag, only the overall status
will be returned. The pipeline and component level statuses will be omitted.

```json
{
    "start_time": "2024-01-18T17:39:15.87324-08:00",
    "healthy": true,
    "status": "StatusRecoverableError",
    "error": "rpc error: code = ResourceExhausted desc = resource exhausted",
    "status_time": "2024-01-18T17:39:35.875024-08:00"
}
```

###### Pipeline Health

The detailed response body for pipeline health is essentially a zoomed in version of the detailed
collector response. It contains the overall status for the pipeline and the statuses of the
individual components. The non-detailed response body contains only the overall status for the
pipeline.

**Verbose Response Example**

Assuming the health check extension is configured with `http.status.endpoint` set to
`localhost:13133` a request to `http://localhost:13133/status?pipeline=traces/http&verbose` will have
a response body such as:


```json
{
    "start_time": "2024-01-18T17:27:12.570394-08:00",
    "healthy": true,
    "status": "StatusOK",
    "status_time": "2024-01-18T17:27:12.571625-08:00",
    "components": {
        "exporter:otlphttp/staging": {
            "healthy": true,
            "status": "StatusOK",
            "status_time": "2024-01-18T17:27:12.571615-08:00"
        },
        "processor:batch": {
            "healthy": true,
            "status": "StatusOK",
            "status_time": "2024-01-18T17:27:12.571621-08:00"
        },
        "receiver:otlp": {
            "healthy": true,
            "status": "StatusOK",
            "status_time": "2024-01-18T17:27:12.571625-08:00"
        }
    }
}
```

**Non-detailed Response Example**

If the same request is made without the verbose flag, only the overall pipline status will be
returned. The component level statuses will be omitted.

```json
{
    "start_time": "2024-01-18T17:39:15.87324-08:00",
    "healthy": true,
    "status": "StatusOK",
    "status_time": "2024-01-18T17:39:15.874236-08:00"
}
```

#### Collector Config Endpoint

The HTTP service optionally exposes an endpoint that provides the collector configuration. Note,
the configuration returned is unfiltered and may contain sensitive information. As such, the
configuration is disabled by default. Enable it using the `http.config.enabled` setting. By
default the path will be `/config`, but it can be changed using the `http.config.path` setting.

⚠️ Take care not to expose this endpoint on non-localhost ports as it contains the unobfuscated
config of the running collector.

#### gRPC Service

The health check extension provides an implementation of the [grpc_health_v1 service]. The service
was chosen for compatibility with existing gRPC health checks, however, it does not provide the
additional detail available with the HTTP service. Additionally, the gRPC service has a less
nuanced view of the world with only two reportable statuses: `HealthCheckResponse_SERVING` and
`HealthCheckResponse_NOT_SERVING`.

##### Mapping of ComponentStatus to HealthCheckResponse_ServingStatus

The HTTP and gRCP services use the same method of component status aggregation to derive
overall collector health and pipeline health from individual status events. The component
statuses map to the following `HealthCheckResponse_ServingStatus`es.

| Status            | HealthCheckResponse_ServingStatus              |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Starting          | NOT_SERVING                                    |
| OK                | SERVING                                        |
| RecoverableError  | SERVING<sup>1</sup>                            |
| PermanentError    | SERVING<sup>2</sup>                            |
| FatalError        | NOT_SERVING                                    |
| Stopping          | NOT_SERVING                                    |
| Stopped           | NOT_SERVING                                    |

1. If `include_recoverable_errors: true`: SERVING when elapsed time < recovery duration; NOT_SERVING
   otherwise.
2. If `include_permanent_errors: true`: NOT_SERVING

##### HealthCheckRequest

The gRPC service exposes two RPCs: `Check` and `Watch` (more about those below). Each takes a
`HealthCheckRequest` argument. The `HealthCheckRequest` message is defined as:

```protobuf
message HealthCheckRequest {
  string service = 1;
}
```

To query for overall collector health, use the empty string `""` as the `service` name. To query for
pipeline health, use the pipeline name as the `service`.

##### Check RPC

The `Check` RPC is defined as:

```protobuf
rpc Check(HealthCheckRequest) returns (HealthCheckResponse)
```

If the service is unknown the RPC will return an error with status `NotFound`. Otherwise it will
return a `HealthCheckResponse` with the serving status as mapped in the table above.

##### Watch Streaming RPC

The `Watch` RPC is defined as:

```protobuf
rpc Watch(HealthCheckRequest) returns (stream HealthCheckResponse)
```

The `Watch` RPC will initiate a stream for the given `service`. If the service is known at the time
the RPC is made, its current status will be sent and changes in status will be sent thereafter. If
the service is unknown, a response with a status of `HealthCheckResponse_SERVICE_UNKNOWN`` will be
sent. The stream will remain open, and if and when the service starts reporting, its status will
begin streaming.

#### Future

There are plans to provide the ability to export status events as OTLP logs adhering to the event
semantic conventions.
