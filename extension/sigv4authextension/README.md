This extension provides Sigv4 authentication for making requests to AWS services. For more information on the Sigv4 process, please look [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html).

## Configuration

The configuration fields are as follows:

* `assume_role`: **Optional**. Specifies the configuration needed to assume a role
  * `arn`: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a role to assume
  * `session_name`: **Optional**. The name of a role session
  * `sts_region`: The AWS region where STS is used to assumed the configured role
    * Note that if a role is intended to be assumed, and `sts_region` is not provided, then `sts_region` will default to the value for `region` if `region` is provided
* `region`: **Optional**. The AWS region for the service you are exporting to for AWS Sigv4. This is differentiated from `sts_region` to handle cross region authentication
    * Note that an attempt will be made to obtain a valid region from the endpoint of the service you are exporting to
    * [List of AWS regions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Concepts.RegionsAndAvailabilityZones.html)
* `service`: **Optional**. The AWS service for AWS Sigv4
    * Note that an attempt will be made to obtain a valid service from the endpoint of the service you are exporting to
