This extension provides [Atlassian Service Authentication Protocol](https://s2sauth.bitbucket.io/) (ASAP) client 
credentials for HTTP or gRPC based exporters. 

## Example Configuration

```yaml

  asapclient:
    # The `kid` as specified by the asap specification.
    key_id: somekeyid
    # The `iss` as specified by the asap specification.
    issuer: someissuer
    # The `aud` as specified by the asap specification.
    audience:
