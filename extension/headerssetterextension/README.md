The `headers_setter` extension implements `ClientAuthenticator` and is used to
set requests headers in `gRPC` / `HTTP` exporters with values provided via
extension configurations or requests metadata (context).

Use cases include but are not limited to enabling multi-tenancy for observability
backends such as [Tempo], [Mimir], [Loki] and others by setting the `X-Scope-OrgID`
header to the value extracted from the context.

## Configuration

The following settings are required:

- `headers`: a list of header configuration objects that specify headers and
  their value sources. Each configuration object has the following properties:
    - `key`: The header name.
    - `action` (default: `upsert`): An action to perform on the header. Supported actions are:
        - `insert`: Inserts the new header if it does not exist.
        - `update`: Updates the header value if it exists.
        - `upsert`: Inserts a header if it does not exist and updates the header
          if it exists.
        - `delete`: Deletes the header.
    - `value`: The header value is looked up from the `value` property of the
      extension configuration.
    - `default_value`: (Optional) Value used if no entry for header key specified in `from_context` is present in request metadata.
    - `from_context`: The header value is looked up from the request metadata,
      such as HTTP headers, using the property value as the key (likely a header
      name).

The `value` and `from_context,default_value` properties are mutually exclusive.

In order for `from_context` to work, other components in the pipeline also need to be configured appropriately:
* If a [batch processor][batch-processor] is present in the pipeline, it must be configured to [preserve client metadata][batch-processor-preserve-metadata]. 
  Add the value which `from_context` needs to the `metadata_keys` of the batch processor.
* Receivers must be configured with `include_metadata: true` so that metadata keys are available to the pipeline.

#### Configuration Example

```yaml
extensions:
  headers_setter:
    headers:
      - action: insert
        key: X-Scope-OrgID
        from_context: tenant_id
        default_value: Org-ID
      - action: upsert
        key: User-ID
        value: user_id
      - action: update
        key: User-ID
        value: user_id
      - action: delete
        key: Some-Header

receivers:
  otlp:
    protocols:
      http:
        include_metadata: true

processors:
  batch:
    # Preserve the tenant-id metadata.
    metadata_keys:
    - tenant_id

exporters:
  loki:
    labels:
      resource:
        container_id: ""
        container_name: ""
    endpoint: https://localhost:<port>/loki/api/v1/push
    auth:
      authenticator: headers_setter

service:
  extensions: [ headers_setter ]
  pipelines:
    traces:
      receivers: [ otlp ]
      processors: [ batch ]
      exporters: [ loki ]
