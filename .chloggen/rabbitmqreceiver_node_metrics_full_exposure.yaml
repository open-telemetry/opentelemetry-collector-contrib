note: "Enhance the RabbitMQ receiver to collect and report additional node-level metrics across multiple categories. These include metrics related to memory, file descriptors, sockets, processes, disk, uptime, scheduling, garbage collection (GC), I/O, message store, connections, clustering, configuration, application info, and context switches. This significantly improves visibility into the performance, state, and resource usage of RabbitMQ nodes."
