subtext: |
  Introduce a setting to ignore errors when the configured encoder. It's advised to set this to `true` when using 
  a custom encoder, and use the new `receiver.googlecloudpubsub.encoding_error` metric to monitor the number of errors. 
  Ignoring the error will cause the receiver to drop the message.
