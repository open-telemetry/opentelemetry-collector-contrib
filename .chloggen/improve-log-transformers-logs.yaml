  When a log transformer processor fails to process an log entry it will include entry's timestamp and attributes in its own logs.
  With this information the user can more easily identify the log file and find the entry that's having issues.

# you should instead start your pull request title with [chore] or use the "Skip Changelog" label.
# Optional: The change log or logs in which this entry should be included.
# e.g. '[user]' or '[user, api]'
# Include 'user' if the change is relevant to end users.
# Include 'api' if there is a change to a library API.
# Default: '[user]'
