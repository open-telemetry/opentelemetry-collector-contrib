  The SQS notification reader was unconditionally deleting messages after processing,
  even when some S3 object retrievals or callback processing failed. This caused data
  loss when a message contained multiple S3 notification records and any of them failed.
  Messages are now only deleted when all records are successfully processed, allowing
  failed records to be retried after the visibility timeout.
