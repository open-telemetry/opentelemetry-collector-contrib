  Users can now specify the authentication mechanism (e.g., SCRAM-SHA-256, GSSAPI, MONGODB-AWS), auth source database,
  and auth mechanism properties when connecting to MongoDB instances. This is particularly useful for MongoDB servers
  that require specific authentication mechanisms. For example, GSSAPI (Kerberos) may require SERVICE_NAME, and
  MONGODB-AWS may require AWS_SESSION_TOKEN when using temporary AWS credentials.
