  The special configuration files can be used through the `agent::config_files` option to control the order
  in which configuration is merged. This allows greater customization of this feature, so that it can adapt
  many use cases without requiring code changes.

  Configuration is merged from the top of the list to the bottom, in order. This means that the first configuration
  files will get overwritten by the later ones.

  Here's a list of the available special configuration options and what they represent:

  - "$OWN_TELEMETRY_CONFIG": configuration to set up the agent's own telemetry (resource, identifying and non-identifying attributes, etc.).
  - "$OPAMP_EXTENSION_CONFIG": configuration for the agent's OpAMP extension to connect to the Supervisor.
  - "$REMOTE_CONFIG": remote configuration received by the Supervisor.

  Here's an example that could be used to configure the Agent:

  ```
  agent:
    config_files:
    - base_config.yaml
    - $OWN_TELEMETRY_CONFIG
    - $OPAMP_EXTENSION_CONFIG
    - $REMOTE_CONFIG
    - compliance_config.yaml
  ```

  If **one or more** of the special files are not specified, they are automatically
  added at predetermined positions in the list. The order is as follows:

  - `$OWN_TELEMETRY_CONFIG`
  - <USER_PROVIDED_CONFIG_FILES>
  - `$OPAMP_EXTENSION_CONFIG`
  - `$REMOTE_CONFIG`
# If your change doesn't affect end users or the exported elements of any package,
# you should instead start your pull request title with [chore] or use the "Skip Changelog" label.
# Optional: The change log or logs in which this entry should be included.
# e.g. '[user]' or '[user, api]'
# Include 'user' if the change is relevant to end users.
# Include 'api' if there is a change to a library API.
# Default: '[user]'
change_logs: [user]
