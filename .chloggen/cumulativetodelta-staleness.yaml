  When the feature gate is enabled, the processor will default to a `max_staleness` of 5 minutes instead of 0 (infinite retention).
  This prevents unbounded memory growth in long-running collector instances while maintaining backward compatibility.
  The feature gate is in alpha stage and disabled by default. Enable it with `--feature-gates=processor.cumulativetodelta.defaultmaxstaleness`.
  Explicitly configured `max_staleness` values will always take precedence over the feature gate default.
