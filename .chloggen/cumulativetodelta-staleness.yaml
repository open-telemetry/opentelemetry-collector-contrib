  The processor now defaults to a `max_staleness` of 1 hour instead of 0 (infinite retention).
  This prevents unbounded memory growth in long-running collector instances, especially when tracking metrics with high cardinality or frequently changing attribute values.
  To restore the previous behavior of infinite retention, explicitly set `max_staleness: 0` in your configuration.

# If your change doesn't affect end users or the exported elements of any package,
# you should instead start your pull request title with [chore] or use the "Skip Changelog" label.
# Optional: The change log or logs in which this entry should be included.
# e.g. '[user]' or '[user, api]'
# Include 'user' if the change is relevant to end users.

# Default: '[user]'
