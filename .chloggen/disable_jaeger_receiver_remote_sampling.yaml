  The jaeger receiver will fail to start if remote_sampling config is specified in it. 
  The `receiver.jaeger.DisableRemoteSampling` feature gate can be disabled to let the receiver start and treat 
  remote_sampling config as no-op. In a future version this feature gate will be removed and the receiver will always 
  fail when remote_sampling config is specified.
