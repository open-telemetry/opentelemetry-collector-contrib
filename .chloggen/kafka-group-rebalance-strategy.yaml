  This enhancement introduces two optional settings: group_rebalance_strategy and group_instance_id.
  These allow users to override the default Range-based rebalance strategy and optionally provide a static instance ID (as per KIP-345) for cooperative sticky balancing.
  This is particularly useful when handling high-cardinality metric workloads, as it reduces rebalance impact, improves cache reuse, and boosts CPU efficiency.
  Both settings are optional to maintain full backward compatibility.
