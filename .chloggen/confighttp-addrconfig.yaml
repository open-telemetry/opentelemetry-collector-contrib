subtext: |
  HTTP server components (namely receivers) now support listening
  on Unix domain sockets in addition to TCP addresses, by configuring
  `transport: unix` and setting `endpoint` to a Unix socket path.

  This is a breaking change to the config structs, but is not breaking
  for end users. Existing YAML configuration options remain unchanged.

# If your change doesn't affect end users or the exported elements of any package,
# you should instead start your pull request title with [chore] or use the "Skip Changelog" label.
# Optional: The change log or logs in which this entry should be included.
# e.g. '[user]' or '[user, api]'
# Include 'user' if the change is relevant to end users.
# Include 'api' if there is a change to a library API.
# Default: '[user]'
change_logs: [api]
