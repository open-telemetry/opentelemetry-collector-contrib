  Previously, when ECS mode was enabled and attributes like `process.executable.name` conflicted with the known ECS field `process.executable`, the deduplication logic would incorrectly add a `.value` suffix to the known field, resulting in `process.executable.value`. This fix ensures protected ECS fields remain unchanged and conflicting nested attributes are properly ignored.
