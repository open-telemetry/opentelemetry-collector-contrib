  You can enable the feature gate with `--feature-gates=receiver.awsfirehose.useAWSLogsEncodingExtensionForCWLogs`.
  By doing so, the receiver/awsfirehose will use the awslogs_encoding extension's CloudWatch Logs unmarshaler
  instead of its built-in implementation. The built-in implementation remains the default behavior for now,
  but will be removed in a future release.
