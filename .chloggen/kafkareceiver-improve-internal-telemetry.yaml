  This change adds the following internal telemetry metrics to the receiver:
    - kafka_broker_connects
    - kafka_broker_closed
    - kafka_broker_throttling_duration
    - kafka_receiver_bytes
    - kafka_receiver_bytes_uncompressed
    - kafka_receiver_latency

  In addition it removes explicit component "name" metrics attribute which should be enabled with "telemetry.newPipelineTelemetry"
  collector feature gate instead. And changes "partition" metrics attribute to more direct "int64" type instead of "string".
