  - Changed metric types from Sum to Gauge for point-in-time measurements:
    - `redis.clients.blocked` - current count of clients pending on blocking calls
    - `redis.clients.connected` - current count of client connections  
    - `redis.rdb.changes_since_last_save` - current count of changes since last dump
    - `redis.slaves.connected` - current count of connected replicas
    - `redis.role` - current role indicator
  - Fixed units for replication offset metrics from "By" (bytes) to "1" (dimensionless):
    - `redis.replication.backlog_first_byte_offset`
    - `redis.replication.offset` 
    - `redis.replication.replica_offset`
  - Added legacy Redis role terminology to `role` attribute enum: `master`, `slave`, `sentinel`
