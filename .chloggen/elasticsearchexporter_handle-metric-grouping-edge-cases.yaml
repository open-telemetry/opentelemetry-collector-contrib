  Fix 2 edge cases where metrics grouping were not done correctly:
  1. In ecs mode, metric grouping now considers data point attributes overwriting resource attributes.
  2. In ecs and otel mode, attributes are now sorted before hashing. Metrics with attributes but in different order are now grouped together.

# If your change doesn't affect end users or the exported elements of any package,
# you should instead start your pull request title with [chore] or use the "Skip Changelog" label.
# Optional: The change log or logs in which this entry should be included.
# e.g. '[user]' or '[user, api]'
# Include 'user' if the change is relevant to end users.
# Include 'api' if there is a change to a library API.
# Default: '[user]'
change_logs: [user]
