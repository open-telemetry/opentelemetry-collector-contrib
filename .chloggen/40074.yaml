  Added a new configuration option to the Coralogix exporter to enable a rate limiter mechanism.
  The rate limiter mechanism is disabled by default. It can be configured using the following configuration options:

  rate_limiter:
    enabled: true
    threshold: 10
    duration: 1m

  Where:
  - `enabled` is a boolean flag to enable the rate limiter mechanism.
  - `threshold` is the number of errors to trigger the rate limiter mechanism (default: 10).
  - `duration` is the duration of the rate limit window (default: 1 minute).

  Note the number of errors is cumulative and reset after the duration has passed or a successful request is made.

# e.g. '[user]' or '[user, api]'
