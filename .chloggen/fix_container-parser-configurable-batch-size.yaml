  The recombine operator now supports setting `max_batch_size: 0` to disable batch size limits.
  This allows unlimited batching, letting entries be combined based only on `max_log_size` and matching conditions.
  If you have `max_batch_size: 0` in your config and want to keep the behavior unchanged, change the configuration to `max_batch_size: 1`.

# If your change doesn't affect end users or the exported elements of any package,
# you should instead start your pull request title with [chore] or use the "Skip Changelog" label.
# Optional: The change log or logs in which this entry should be included.
# e.g. '[user]' or '[user, api]'
# Include 'user' if the change is relevant to end users.
# Include 'api' if there is a change to a library API.
# Default: '[user]'
change_logs: [user]
