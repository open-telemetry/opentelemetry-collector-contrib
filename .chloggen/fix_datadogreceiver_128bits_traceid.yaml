  This fix is released behind a featuregate so as to not be a breaking change for users. To enable it, enable 
  `receiver.datadogreceiver.Enable128BitTraceID`. The feature uses an LRU cache that will keep the last 100 trace ids by
  default. This can be configured via `receivers.datadog.trace_id_cache_size`.

# If your change doesn't affect end users or the exported elements of any package,
# you should instead start your pull request title with [chore] or use the "Skip Changelog" label.
# Optional: The change log or logs in which this entry should be included.
# e.g. '[user]' or '[user, api]'
# Include 'user' if the change is relevant to end users.
# Include 'api' if there is a change to a library API.
# Default: '[user]'
change_logs: [user]
