  Adds `traces_dynamic_id` configuration option to allow setting document IDs based on span and span event attributes using the `elasticsearch.document_id` attribute.
  This prevents duplicate documents from being created when the same span is sent multiple times, similar to the existing `logs_dynamic_id` feature.
  Disabled by default.
