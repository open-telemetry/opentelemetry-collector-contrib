subtext: |
  Previously, any `include` pattern that included some manner of wildcard (`*` or `**`) would
  be case-sensitive on Windows, but Windows filepaths are by default case-insensitive. This meant
  that in a directory with the files `a.log` and `b.LOG`, the pattern `*.log` would previously only
  match `a.log`. With the `filelog.windows.caseInsensitive` featuregate enabled, it will match both `a.log`
  and `b.LOG` when on Windows. The behaviour is the same as always on other operating systems, as all other
  currently supported platforms for the Collector have case-sensitive filesystems.

# If your change doesn't affect end users or the exported elements of any package,
# you should instead start your pull request title with [chore] or use the "Skip Changelog" label.
# Optional: The change log or logs in which this entry should be included.
# e.g. '[user]' or '[user, api]'
# Include 'user' if the change is relevant to end users.
# Include 'api' if there is a change to a library API.
# Default: '[user]'
