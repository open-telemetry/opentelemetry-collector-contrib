  With the introduction of query level log collection, the oracledbreceiver can now send metrics for Top N queries, 
  filtered based on the highest CPU time consumed. The number of queries can be configured. This helps the user to have
  a better understanding of the database operations. In addition to this, query samples can be collected for the currently
  executing queries. This enhancement enables users to proactively monitor and manage the database performance.
