note: Turn noisy `warn` log about Pub/Sub servers into `debug`, and turn the reset count into a metric

subtext: |
  The receiver uses the Google Cloud Pub/Sub StreamingPull API and keeps a open connection. The Pub/Sub servers
  recurrently close the connection after a time period to avoid a long-running sticky connection. Before the
  receiver logged `warn` log lines everytime this happened. These log lines are moved to debug so that fleets with
  lots of collectors with the receiver don't span logs at warn level. To keep track of the resets, whenever a
  connection reset happens a `otelcol_receiver_googlecloudpubsub_stream_restarts` metric is increased by one.
