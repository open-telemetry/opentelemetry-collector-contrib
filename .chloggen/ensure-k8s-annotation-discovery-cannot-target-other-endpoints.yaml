change_type: enhancement

# The name of the component, or a single word describing the area of concern, (e.g. receiver/filelog)
component: receiver/receivercreator, receiver/tlscheckreceiver

# A brief description of the change.  Surround your text with quotes ("") if it needs to start with a backtick (`).
note: Add a Discoverable interface to the receiver creator that discovered receivers can implement to provide custom endpoint validation during k8s annotation-based discovery. This ensures that annotation-provided configurations can only target the discovered endpoint, preventing receivers from being configured to scrape arbitrary external endpoints.

# Mandatory: One or more tracking issues related to the change. You can use the PR number here if no issue exists.
issues: [36595]

# (Optional) One or more lines of additional information to render under the primary note.
# These lines will be padded with 2 spaces and then inserted directly into the document.
# Use pipe (|) for multiline entries.

  The tlscheckreceiver implements the Discoverable interface to validate that
  all target endpoints in the annotation-provided configuration match the
  discovered endpoint. This was done to show how the Discoverable interface can be used.
