  FluentD supports record entries with uint64 types. OpenTelemetry log attributes only support int64 and no uint64.
  The old solution would overflow with uint64 values greater than `math.MaxInt64` and result in negative attribute values.
  This fix changes that behaviour by storing only those large values as string attributes instead.

# If your change doesn't affect end users or the exported elements of any package,
# you should instead start your pull request title with [chore] or use the "Skip Changelog" label.
# Optional: The change log or logs in which this entry should be included.
# e.g. '[user]' or '[user, api]'
# Include 'user' if the change is relevant to end users.
# Include 'api' if there is a change to a library API.
# Default: '[user]'
