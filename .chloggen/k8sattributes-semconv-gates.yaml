  - Added `processor.k8sattributes.EmitV1K8sConventions` feature gate to enable stable semantic convention attributes (singular form: `k8s.<workload>.label.<key>` and `k8s.<workload>.annotation.<key>`)
  - Added `processor.k8sattributes.DontEmitV0K8sConventions` feature gate to disable legacy non-compliant attributes (plural form: `k8s.<workload>.labels.<key>` and `k8s.<workload>.annotations.<key>`)
  - Both feature gates are in `alpha` stage and disabled by default
  - The processor now validates that legacy attributes cannot be disabled without enabling stable attributes
  - Deprecated `k8sattr.labelsAnnotationsSingular.allow` feature gate in favor of the new semconv-compliant gates (will be removed in v0.150.0)
  - During migration period, both legacy and stable attributes can coexist when `EmitV1K8sConventions` is enabled but `DontEmitV0K8sConventions` is not
