  The adaptive window sizing feature enables dynamic adjustment of the isolation forest sliding window size based on:
  - Traffic velocity and throughput patterns
  - Memory usage and resource constraints  
  - Model stability and performance metrics
  This enhancement improves resource utilization and anomaly detection accuracy for varying workload patterns.
