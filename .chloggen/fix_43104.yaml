  The franz-go Kafka consumer was incorrectly using `default_fetch_size` (a Sarama-specific setting) instead of `max_fetch_size` when configuring `kgo.FetchMaxBytes`.
  This fix ensures the correct parameter is used and adds validation to prevent `max_fetch_size` from being less than `min_fetch_size`.
  The default value for `max_fetch_size` has been changed from 0 (unlimited) to 1048576 (1 MiB) to maintain backward compatibility with the previous (incorrect) behavior.
