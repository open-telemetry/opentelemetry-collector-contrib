  The span metrics connector now supports extracting sampling information from W3C tracestate 
  to generate extrapolated span metrics with adjusted counts. This enables accurate metric 
  aggregation for sampled traces by computing stochastic-rounded adjusted counts based on 
  the sampling threshold (ot.th field) in the tracestate. Key features include:

  - Stochastic rounding for fractional adjusted counts using integer-only operations
  - Single-entry cache for consecutive identical tracestates (4% overhead in benchmarks)
  - Support for mixed-mode services where some spans have tracestate and others don't
  - New sampling.method attribute to distinguish between adjusted and non-adjusted metrics
  - Histogram support for observing multiple events at once

  Performance characteristics:
  - ~4% overhead for traces with tracestate (3-span batch: 3684ns → 3829ns). Overhead will further diminish with larger batches.
  - Scales linearly with trace size (500 spans: 577μs → 581μs)
  - Zero allocations for common cases with caching enabled

# If your change doesn't affect end users or the exported elements of any package,
# you should instead start your pull request title with [chore] or use the "Skip Changelog" label.
# Optional: The change log or logs in which this entry should be included.
# e.g. '[user]' or '[user, api]'
# Include 'user' if the change is relevant to end users.
# Include 'api' if there is a change to a library API.
# Default: '[user]'
