  Added top query (most CPU time consumed) collection. The query will gather the queries took most of the time during the last
  query interval and report related metrics. The number of queries can be configured. This will enable user to have better
  understanding on what is going on with the database. This enhancement empowers users to not only monitor but also actively 
  manage and optimize their MSSQL database performance based on real usage patterns.
