  If the `_created` metric was present in the Histogram, Summary or Counter
  metric family, only then its values is used to set `StartTimeUnixNano` on the
  relevant OTLP metric and dropped afterwards. Otherwise, it is converted to the
  monotonic OTLP Sum metric.
  This behaviour is disabled by default. Use the `receiver.prometheusreceiver.UseCreatedMetric`
  to enable it.
