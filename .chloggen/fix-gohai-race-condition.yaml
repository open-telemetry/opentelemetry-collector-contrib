  Deep copy the host metadata payload before passing it to ConsumeHostMetadata() to prevent
  concurrent map access when the reporter's gohai collector refreshes maps while JSON marshaling
  iterates over them. This fixes the "fatal error: concurrent map iteration and map write" panic
  that occurred with multiple concurrent metric consumers and host metadata enabled.
