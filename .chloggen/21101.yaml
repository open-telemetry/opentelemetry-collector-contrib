  The connector now excludes unstable resource attributes (like process.pid) from metric grouping by default.
  Users can explicitly configure which resource attributes to use via `resource_metrics_key_attributes`.
  If nothing is configured, the connector will use a default set of resource attributes.

  This feature is managed by the `connector.spanmetrics.defaultResourceMetricsKeyAttributes` feature gate.
