  The filelog receiver now correctly handles Windows UNC network paths (e.g., \\server\share\logs\*.log).
  Previously, the receiver could list files from network shares but failed to open them due to path corruption
  during normalization. This fix converts UNC paths to Windows extended-length format (\\?\UNC\server\share\path)
  which is more reliable and not affected by filepath.Clean() issues.
