component: "splunkenterprisereceiver"

# A brief description of the change.  Surround your text with quotes ("") if it needs to start with a backtick (`).
note: |
  "Updated the behavior of `splunk.health` to create metrics for all health colors (`green`, `yellow`, and `red`), 
  but only assign a value of `1` if that is the active color. To avoid a great increase in cardinality, `splunk.health`
  now defaults to not recursively read the subfeatures, and will only return the highest level features. Recursive
  reading may be enabled with `enable_health_feature_recursion: true` in the receiver config.
  `splunk.health` can be enabled on all node types."
