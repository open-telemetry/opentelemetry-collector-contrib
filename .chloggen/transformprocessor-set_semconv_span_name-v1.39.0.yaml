  The `set_semconv_span_name` processor now recognizes semantic conventions 1.38.0 and 1.39.0, allowing span names to be
  determined using the latest rules. Support for the `rpc.system.name` attribute (introduced in 1.39.0) has been added
  so span names can reflect the RPC system. Backward compatibility is preserved: the `rpc.system` attribute remains
  supported.
