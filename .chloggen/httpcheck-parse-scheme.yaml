  Previously, when configured with an endpoint without HTTP/HTTPS scheme like "opentelemetry.io",
  the receiver would start correctly, but fail to check the endpoint, producing the `httpcheck.error`
  metric on every collection interval. After this change, the receiver fails to start, writing
  an error log saying that you need to provide a scheme in the endpoint.
