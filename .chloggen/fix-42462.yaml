  This change introduces a breaking change, which is now guarded by the feature gate `connector.spanmetrics.useSecondAsDefaultMetricsUnit`.
  Currently, the feature gate is disabled by default, so the unit will remain `ms`. After one release cycle, the unit will switch to `s` and the feature gate will also be enabled by default.
