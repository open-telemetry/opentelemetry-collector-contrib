subtext: |
  Users can provide custom file partitions using [strftime](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/strftime.3.html) formatting.
  The default value of `year=%Y/month=%m/day=%d/hour=%H/minute=%M` matches the older pattern (with `s3_partition: minute`)
  
  If users do not provide a value for `s3_prefix`, the exporter will not create a `/` folder in the bucket.

# If your change doesn't affect end users or the exported elements of any package,
# you should instead start your pull request title with [chore] or use the "Skip Changelog" label.
# Optional: The change log or logs in which this entry should be included.
# e.g. '[user]' or '[user, api]'
# Include 'user' if the change is relevant to end users.
# Include 'api' if there is a change to a library API.
# Default: '[user]'
change_logs: [user]
