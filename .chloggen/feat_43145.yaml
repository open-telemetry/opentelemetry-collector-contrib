  [HTTP](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/http/http-spans/),
  [RPC](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/rpc/rpc-spans/),
  [messaging](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/messaging/messaging-spans/), and
  [database](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/database/) spans. In other cases, the original `span.name`
  is returned unchanged.

  The primary use of `GetSemconvSpanName()` is alongside the
  [Span Metrics Connector](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/connector/spanmetricsconnector)
  to address high-cardinality issues in span metrics when `span.name` does not comply with the OTel requirement
  that span names be low cardinality.

# you should instead start your pull request title with [chore] or use the "Skip Changelog" label.
# Optional: The change log or logs in which this entry should be included.
# e.g. '[user]' or '[user, api]'
# Include 'user' if the change is relevant to end users.
# Include 'api' if there is a change to a library API.
# Default: '[user]'
