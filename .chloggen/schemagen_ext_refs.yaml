    The `schemagen` tool has been enhanced to support external references when generating
    configuration schemas for OpenTelemetry Collector components. This improvement allows
    the tool to accurately reference and include schema definitions from external packages,
    facilitating better modularity and reuse of configuration schemas across different components.
