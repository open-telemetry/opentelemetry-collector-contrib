  The `virtual_node_enabled` config option allows users to explicitly enable or disable
  virtual node creation without relying on the feature gate. When set to true, virtual
  nodes are enabled regardless of the feature gate. When set to false, virtual nodes
  are disabled regardless of the feature gate. When not set, the connector falls back
  to the `connector.servicegraph.virtualNode` feature gate for backwards compatibility.
