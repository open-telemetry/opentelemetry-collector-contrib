  GitHub events from skipped jobs sometimes have the createdAt timestamp to be
  AFTER the startedAt timestamp. This causes the created span to having a time
  of some crazy long time, while the duration attribute is negative. This change
  accounts for that inconsistent behavior from GitHub and adds the corresponding
  tests.

# If your change doesn't affect end users or the exported elements of any package,
# you should instead start your pull request title with [chore] or use the "Skip Changelog" label.
# Optional: The change log or logs in which this entry should be included.
# e.g. '[user]' or '[user, api]'
# Include 'user' if the change is relevant to end users.

# Default: '[user]'
