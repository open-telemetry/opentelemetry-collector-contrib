  The new `max_log_size_behavior` setting controls what happens when a log entry exceeds `max_log_size`.
  - `split` (default): Splits oversized log entries into multiple log entries. This is the existing behavior.
  - `truncate`: Truncates oversized log entries and drops the remainder, emitting only a single truncated log entry.

# you should instead start your pull request title with [chore] or use the "Skip Changelog" label.
