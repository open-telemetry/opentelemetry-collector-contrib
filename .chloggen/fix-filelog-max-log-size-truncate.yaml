  The `max_log_size` setting now correctly truncates log entries that exceed the maximum size and drops the remainder, aligning the implementation with the documented behavior.
  Previously, oversized log entries were incorrectly split into multiple log entries, which could lead to unexpected log processing behavior.
  This fix ensures that when a log entry exceeds `max_log_size`, only the truncated portion (up to `max_log_size`) is processed as a single log entry, and the remainder is dropped entirely.
