  More complex evaluators might allocate resources to manage their internal state, this PR adds an
  optional interface `StoppableEvaluator` which allows the tailsamplingprocessor to call `Stop`
  when the evaluator is unloaded. `Stop` is expected to not block and will be called when the policy
  is replaced or the processor is shut down.
