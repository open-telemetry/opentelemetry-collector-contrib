  Previously, OTTL paths could only use the `instrumentation_scope` context when combined with 
  lower-level contexts like `log` or `metric`. This change allows the `scope` context to be 
  used interchangeably with `instrumentation_scope`, improving flexibility and consistency.

# If your change doesn't affect end users or the exported elements of any package,
# you should instead start your pull request title with [chore] or use the "Skip Changelog" label.
# Optional: The change log or logs in which this entry should be included.
# e.g. '[user]' or '[user, api]'
# Include 'user' if the change is relevant to end users.
# Include 'api' if there is a change to a library API.
# Default: '[user]'
change_logs: [api, user]
