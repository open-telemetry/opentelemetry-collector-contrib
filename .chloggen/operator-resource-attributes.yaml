subtext: |
  If you are using the file log receiver, you can now create the same resource attributes as traces (via OTLP) received
  from an application instrumented with the OpenTelemetry Operator -
  simply by adding the `extract: { operator_rules: { enabled: true } }` configuration to the `k8sattributesprocessor` processor.
  See the [documentation](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/processor/k8sattributesprocessor/README.md#config-example) for more details.
