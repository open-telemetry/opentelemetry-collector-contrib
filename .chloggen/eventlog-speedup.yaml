note: Improved performance of the Windows Event Log Receiver
issues: [43195]

subtext: |
  Previously, the Windows Event Log Receiver could only process events up to 100 messages per second with default settings.
  This was because the receiver would read at most `max_reads` messages within each configured `poll_interval`, even if
  additional events were already available.

  This restriction has been removed. The `poll_interval` parameter behaves as described in the documentation:
  The `poll_interval` parameter now only takes effect after all current events have been read.

  For users who prefer the previous behavior, a new configuration option, `max_events_per_poll`, has been introduced.
