  The Supervisor now starts with a fallback configuration when it cannot connect 
  to the OpAMP backend at startup and there's no previous configuration state persisted.
  The regular configuration is restored When the OpAMP backend is healthy again and the 
  Supervisor connects to it.

  If a previous configuration state is persisted, it will be used to start the Collector.
