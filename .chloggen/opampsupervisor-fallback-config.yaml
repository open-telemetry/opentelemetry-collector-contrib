  The Supervisor now supports switching to a fallback configuration in two scenarios:
  1. Cannot connect to the OpAMP backend at startup, controlled by `fallback_startup_timeout`.
  2. Lost connection to the OpAMP backend after startup, controlled by `fallback_runtime_timeout`.
  Both options are time durations, allowing the OpAMP client to handle retries before switching.
  They can be disabled by setting them to zero or omitting them entirely. The two timeouts are
  independent, allowing different behaviors for startup vs runtime connection failures.
