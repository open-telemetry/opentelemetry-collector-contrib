subtext: |
  Previously, when one sub-exporter failed, all data (including successfully sent data) was retried,
  causing incorrect metrics and unnecessary retries. Now only failed data is retried using consumererror
  wrappers, and metrics accurately reflect per-endpoint success/failure.

# If your change doesn't affect end users or the exported elements of any package,
# you should instead start your pull request title with [chore] or use the "Skip Changelog" label.
