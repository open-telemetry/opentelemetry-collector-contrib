  HMAC functions provide rainbow table resistant hashing by using a secret key, making it impossible to reverse-engineer original values without the key.
  This enables true pseudonymization per GDPR Article 4(5) requirements while maintaining consistency for pattern analysis.
  Configure with `hash_function: hmac-sha256` (or `hmac-sha512`) and `hmac_key: "${env:REDACTION_SECRET_KEY}"`.
