  Previously, when using multiline pattern matching with non-UTF-8 encodings (e.g., utf-16le), 
  the encoding was not properly applied during pattern matching, causing multiline patterns to fail. 
  This fix ensures that the specified encoding is correctly applied when processing multiline patterns, 
  allowing proper parsing of files with fixed-length records and no line terminators in various encodings.
