subtext:
  Overhaul in document routing.
  Deprecate and make `{logs,metrics,traces}_dynamic_index` config no-op.
  Config validation error on `{logs,metrics,traces}_dynamic_index::enabled` and `{logs,metrics,traces}_index` set at the same time, as users who rely on dynamic index should not set `{logs,metrics,traces}_index`.
  Remove `elasticsearch.index.{prefix,suffix}` handling. Replace it with `elasticsearch.index` handling that uses attribute value as index directly. Users rely on the previously supported `elasticsearch.index.prefix` and `elasticsearch.index.suffix` should migrate to a transform processor that sets `elasticsearch.index`.
  Fix a bug where receiver-based routing overwrites data_stream.dataset.
