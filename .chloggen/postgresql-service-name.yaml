# Use this changelog template to create an entry for release notes.

# One of 'breaking', 'deprecation', 'new_component', 'enhancement', 'bug_fix'
change_type: breaking

# The name of the component, or a single word describing the area of concern, (e.g. receiver/filelog)
component: receiver/postgresql

# A brief description of the change.  Surround your text with quotes ("") if it needs to start with a backtick (`).
note: Add `service.name`, `server.host`, and `server.port` resource attributes, change `service.instance.id` to UUID v5

# Mandatory: One or more tracking issues related to the change. You can use the PR number here if no issue exists.
issues: [45347]

# (Optional) One or more lines of additional information to render under the primary note.
# These lines will be padded with 2 spaces and then inserted directly into the document.
# Use pipe (|) for multiline entries.

  - `service.name`: constant value "postgresql"
  - `server.host`: the PostgreSQL server hostname
  - `server.port`: the PostgreSQL server port number
  - `service.instance.id`: changed from host:port to deterministic UUID v5 based on resource identifiers (host, port, database, schema, table, index)
  This ensures the OTel semantic convention triplet (service.namespace, service.name, service.instance.id) is unique per resource.

# If your change doesn't affect end users or the exported elements of any package,
# you should instead start your pull request title with [chore] or use the "Skip Changelog" label.
# Optional: The change log or logs in which this entry should be included.
# e.g. '[user]' or '[user, api]'
# Include 'user' if the change is relevant to end users.
# Include 'api' if there is a change to a library API.
# Default: '[user]'
change_logs: [user]
