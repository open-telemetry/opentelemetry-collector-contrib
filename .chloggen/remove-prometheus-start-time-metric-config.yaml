  The `use_start_time_metric` and `start_time_metric_regex` configuration options have been removed after being deprecated in v0.142.0.
  Users who have these options set in their configuration will experience collector startup failures after upgrading.
  To migrate, remove these configuration options and use the `metricstarttime` processor instead for equivalent functionality.
