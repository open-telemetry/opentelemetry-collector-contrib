  The OTTL math expression parser did not correctly handle unary signs for plus
  and minus. Expressions like "3+-5" would not parse correctly. Additionally,
  floating point constants that had a decimal point but no fractional digits
  (e.g., "3.") were not handled properly and could crash the parser. This change
  moves the sign handling out of the lexer and into the parser.
  - Correctly parse unary plus and minus operators in mathematical expressions.
  - Unary plus is a no-op, but is explicitly handled.
  - Handle floating point constants that have a decimal point but no fractional digits (e.g.,
  "3."). These are now parsed as valid floating point numbers.
  - Many tests were added to verify correct parsing and evaluation of these cases.

# Optional: The change log or logs in which this entry should be included.
# e.g. '[user]' or '[user, api]'
# Include 'user' if the change is relevant to end users.
# Include 'api' if there is a change to a library API.
