subtext: |
  The processor now correctly validates that `host.name` contains an IP address before using it for pod association.
  Previously, textual hostnames were incorrectly used for pod lookups, causing spans and metrics from one workload
  to receive metadata from unrelated pods that shared the same hostname.
