note: "Promote the receiver.prometheusreceiver.RemoveStartTimeAdjustment feature gate to stable, making start time adjustment in the Prometheus receiver permanently disabled and requiring users to use the metricstarttime processor instead of use_start_time_metric/start_time_metric_regex."

subtext: |
  Previously, users could disable the RemoveStartTimeAdjustment feature gate to temporarily keep the legacy start time adjustment behavior in the Prometheus receiver.
  With this promotion to stable and bounded registration, that gate can no longer be disabled; the receiver will no longer set StartTime on metrics based on process_start_time_seconds.
  Users who relied on this behavior should migrate to the metricstarttime processor for equivalent functionality.
