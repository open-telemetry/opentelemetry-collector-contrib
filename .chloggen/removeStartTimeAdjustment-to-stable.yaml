  Previously, users could disable the RemoveStartTimeAdjustment feature gate to temporarily keep the legacy start time adjustment behavior in the Prometheus receiver.
  With this promotion to stable and bounded registration, that gate can no longer be disabled; the receiver will no longer set StartTime on metrics based on process_start_time_seconds, and users should migrate to the metricstarttime processor for equivalent functionality.
  This change also disables the receiver.prometheusreceiver.UseCreatedMetric feature gate, which previously used the `<metric>_created` series to derive start timestamps for counters, summaries, and histograms when scraping non OpenMetrics protocols.
  However, this does not mean that the `_created` series is always ignored: when using the OpenMetrics 1.0 protocol, Prometheus itself continues to interpret the `_created` series as the start timestamp, so only the receiver-side handling for other scrape protocols has been removed.
