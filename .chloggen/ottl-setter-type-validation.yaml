note: Return errors when OTTL context accessors receive values of the wrong type (part 2)
issues: [40198]
subtext: |
  Setters in OTTL contexts now validate that values are of the expected type and return
  descriptive errors when type mismatches occur, improving debugging experience.
  This is the continuation of work done in \#43505, addressing remaining context such
  as datapoint, profile, resource, span, and span event.

  **Note:** Users may see new errors from OTTL statements that were previously silently failing
  due to type mismatches. These errors indicate pre-existing issues in OTTL configurations that
  were not being applied as expected.
