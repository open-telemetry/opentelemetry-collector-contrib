note: Return errors when OTTL context accessors receive values of the wrong type (part 2)
issues: [40198]
subtext: |
  Setters in OTTL contexts now validate that values are of the expected type and return
  descriptive errors when type mismatches occur. This is the continuation of work done in
  \#43505, addressing remaining contexts: datapoint, profile, profilesample, resource, span,
  and spanevent.

  Changes include:
  - Slice setters (explicit_bounds, bucket_counts, positive.bucket_counts, negative.bucket_counts)
    now use SetCommonTypedSliceValues/SetCommonIntSliceValues for better type handling.
  - SetMap now returns an error for invalid value types instead of silently ignoring them.

  **Note:** Users may see new errors from OTTL statements that were previously silently failing
  due to type mismatches. These errors indicate pre-existing issues in OTTL configurations that
  were not being applied as expected.
