  This change ensures that the collector can start up if the Kafka cluster is not available
  or the consumer group creation fails due to some other transient, retryable error.

  We also now report the component status to indicate if and when the consumer group has been
  successfully created, and whether the receiver is ready to consume messages. This can be
  observed via the healthcheckv2 extension.
