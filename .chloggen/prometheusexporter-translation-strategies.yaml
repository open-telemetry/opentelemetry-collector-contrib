  The new `translation_strategy` option provides four different translation modes:
  - `UnderscoreEscapingWithSuffixes`: Escapes special characters to underscores and appends type/unit suffixes
  - `UnderscoreEscapingWithoutSuffixes`: Escapes special characters but omits suffixes
  - `NoUTF8EscapingWithSuffixes`: Preserves UTF-8 characters while adding suffixes
  - `NoTranslation`: Passes metric names through unaltered
  When `translation_strategy` is set, it always takes precedence over the deprecated `add_metric_suffixes` option.
  The `exporter.prometheusexporter.DisableAddMetricSuffixes` feature gate can be used to completely ignore the deprecated `add_metric_suffixes` setting.

# you should instead start your pull request title with [chore] or use the "Skip Changelog" label.
# Optional: The change log or logs in which this entry should be included.
# e.g. '[user]' or '[user, api]'
# Include 'user' if the change is relevant to end users.
# Include 'api' if there is a change to a library API.
# Default: '[user]'
