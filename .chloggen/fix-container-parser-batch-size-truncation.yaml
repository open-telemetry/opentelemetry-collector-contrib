  The container parser now supports a `recombine` configuration section with two parameters:
  - `max_batch_size`: Controls batching for CRI/containerd logs with P/F tags (default: 1000)
  - `max_unmatched_batch_size`: Controls batching for Docker logs without P/F tags (default: 100)

  This fixes an issue where multiline logs were truncated at 1.6 MB when they exceeded the hardcoded limits. Users can now configure these values for applications that produce very long multiline logs such as large stack traces, JSON payloads, or single-line logs that span multiple Docker JSON entries.

  Example configuration:
  ```yaml
  receivers:
    filelog:
      include: ["/var/log/containers/*.log"]
      operators:
        - type: container
          recombine:
            max_batch_size: 2000
            max_unmatched_batch_size: 500
  ```

# If your change doesn't affect end users or the exported elements of any package,
# you should instead start your pull request title with [chore] or use the "Skip Changelog" label.
# Optional: The change log or logs in which this entry should be included.
# e.g. '[user]' or '[user, api]'
# Include 'user' if the change is relevant to end users.
# Include 'api' if there is a change to a library API.
# Default: '[user]'
change_logs: [user]
