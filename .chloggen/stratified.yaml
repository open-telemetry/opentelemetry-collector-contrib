# A brief description of the change.  Surround your text with quotes ("") if it needs to start with a backtick (`).
note: The current implementation of the probabilistic sampling policy in the tail sampling processor in the OpenTelemetry Collector Contrib repository randomly samples a percentage of traces. This approach does not ensure that all the application service workflows associated with different transaction types get a representation in the sampled set of traces. A user can initiate any specific application functionality/operation, which subsequently triggers a corresponding subset of service components (or a workflow). For instance, in an e-commerce application designed using a microservices architecture, distinct operations, such as browsing, adding to a cart, and others will invoke different microservices. Each functionality will invoke service components in a defined order, with the invocation order representing a subgraph within the broader application workflow. Defining this subgraph of service components for servicing a request as the trajectory, for a sampled set of traces to truly represent an application and thus be of more value to the downstream tasks, all the trajectories must get at least one representation in the sampled set of traces for the given sampling interval. This new sampling policy, called the stratified sampling policy, samples a new trajectory whenever it is encountered for the first time within a sampling interval. If a trajectory has already been observed within that interval, the policy will revert to a probabilistic sampling approach, where trajectories are selected based on predefined probabilities. This ensures that newly encountered trajectories are prioritized for sampling while maintaining flexibility for previously seen trajectories.
