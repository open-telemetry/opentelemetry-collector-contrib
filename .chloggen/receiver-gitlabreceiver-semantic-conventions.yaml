  This PR refactors the GitLab receiver to facilitate adding future webhook event handlers and includes several improvements:
  
  **Architectural Refactoring:**
  - Implemented event router pattern (`event_router.go`) for extensible event handling
  - Separated pipeline and job event handlers into dedicated files (`pipeline_event_handler.go`, `job_event_handler.go`)
  - Makes it easy to add new GitLab webhook event handlers (push hook, deployment hook, etc.) in the future
  
  **Code Organization:**
  - Moved test JSON payloads from inline code to `testdata/` directory following OpenTelemetry patterns
  - Consolidated utility functions into `internal/utils.go` for better code organization
  - Added comprehensive tests for job and pipeline event handlers
  
  **Bug Fix (Issue #45756):**
  - Fixed handling of pipeline events with jobs containing null/empty timestamps (e.g., skipped manual jobs)
  - Stage time calculation now only processes jobs with valid timestamps
  - Previously caused "invalid startedAt timestamp: time is empty" errors
  
  **Semantic Conventions:**
  - Updated job event metrics to use OpenTelemetry semantic convention attributes:
    - `gitlab.job.id` → `cicd.pipeline.task.run.id`
    - `gitlab.job.name` → `cicd.pipeline.task.name`
    - `gitlab.job.status` → `cicd.pipeline.task.run.result`
    - `gitlab.job.runner.id` → `cicd.worker.id`
    - `gitlab.job.runner.description` → `cicd.worker.name`
    - `gitlab.job.failure_reason` → `error.type` (for failed jobs in traces)
