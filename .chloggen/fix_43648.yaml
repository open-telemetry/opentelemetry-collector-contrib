  Some metrics were not collected because we requested all available aggregation types. This led to 501 errors, as the Azure API returned responses indicating that certain aggregations were not implemented.
  We now use the supported aggregations field from each metric definition to filter and request only the aggregations that are actually supported.
  The user can expect less 501 errors in the logs and more metrics in the results.
