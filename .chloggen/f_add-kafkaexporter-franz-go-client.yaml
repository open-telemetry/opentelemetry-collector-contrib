  This change adds an experimental opt-in support to use the franz-go client in the Kafka exporter.
  The franz-go client is a high-performance Kafka client that can improve the performance of the Kafka exporter.
  The default client remains sarama, which is used by the Kafka receiver and other components.
  Enable the franz-go client by setting the `exporter.kafkaexporter.UseFranzGo` feature gate.
