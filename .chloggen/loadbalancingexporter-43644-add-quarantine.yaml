  - Added a quarantine feature for unhealthy endpoints, delaying retries to those endpoints after a configurable period (default: 30s).
  - Quarantine settings are configurable via the DNS resolver's `quarantine` section.
  - The load balancer will avoid sending data to endpoints marked as unhealthy until their quarantine period expires, using healthy endpoints in the hash ring without triggering unnecessary ring updates.
  - This increases resilience by reducing the risk of exporters being stuck in degraded states with repeated failed attempts.
  - This feature currently applies only to the DNS resolver.
