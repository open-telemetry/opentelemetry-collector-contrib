  The container parser now supports configurable batch size settings for handling large multiline logs:
  - `max_batch_size`: Controls batching for CRI/containerd logs with P/F tags (default: 0, unlimited)

  The default `max_log_size` has been increased from 100KB to 10MB to prevent truncation of large logs while still allowing users to override it.

  This addresses issues where multiline logs were truncated when they exceeded the previous limits. Users can now configure these values for applications that produce very long multiline logs such as large stack traces or JSON payloads.

  Example configuration:
  ```yaml
  receivers:
    filelog:
      include: ["/var/log/containers/*.log"]
      operators:
        - type: container
          max_batch_size: 2000
  ```

# If your change doesn't affect end users or the exported elements of any package,
# you should instead start your pull request title with [chore] or use the "Skip Changelog" label.
# Optional: The change log or logs in which this entry should be included.
# e.g. '[user]' or '[user, api]'
# Include 'user' if the change is relevant to end users.
# Include 'api' if there is a change to a library API.
# Default: '[user]'
change_logs: [user]
