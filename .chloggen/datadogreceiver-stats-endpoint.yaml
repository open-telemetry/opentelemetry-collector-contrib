  The Datadog Receiver can now process APM trace stats payloads sent by the Datadog Agent via the /api/v0.2/stats endpoint.
  The handler correctly processes gzipped msgpack payloads, decodes them into StatsPayload, translates them into OpenTelemetry-compatible metrics, and forwards them to the configured metrics consumer.
  This enables the complete APM metrics flow: Application → Datadog SDK → Datadog Agent → OpenTelemetry Collector → OTEL Backends.
