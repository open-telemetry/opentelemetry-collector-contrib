change_type: breaking

# The name of the component, or a single word describing the area of concern, (e.g. filelogreceiver)
component: processor/tail_sampling

# A brief description of the change.  Surround your text with quotes ("") if it needs to start with a backtick (`).
note: Replace policy latency metric with total time spent executing specific sampling policy.

# Mandatory: One or more tracking issues related to the change. You can use the PR number here if no issue exists.
issues: [42620]

# (Optional) One or more lines of additional information to render under the primary note.
# These lines will be padded with 2 spaces and then inserted directly into the document.
# Use pipe (|) for multiline entries.
subtext: The existing latency metric was misleading and expensive to compute. The new cpu time metric can be used to find expensive policies instead.

# you should instead start your pull request title with [chore] or use the "Skip Changelog" label.
# Optional: The change log or logs in which this entry should be included.
