  The servicegraphconnector now supports a `metrics_timestamp_offset` configuration option that allows 
  adjusting metric timestamps by subtracting a specified duration from the current time. This enables 
  metrics to appear as if they were generated in the past, which can be useful for testing scenarios 
  or when aligning metrics with historical data. The default value is 0, preserving existing behavior.
