  Ensure that feature flags "enable_receive_resource_spans_v2" and "enable_operation_and_resource_name_logic_v2"
  are also enabled on both Datadog Exporter and Datadog Connector so that span attributes are properly
  mapped to span type and span resource in Datadog APM; otherwise spans and apm stats may not be 
  obfuscated and attributes on stats payloads may not match traces.
  See https://docs.datadoghq.com/opentelemetry/schema_semantics/semantic_mapping/?tab=datadogexporter#mapping-opentelemetry-database-system-type-to-datadog-span-type
  
  NOTE: Long/complex SQL queries may cause a performance impact on APM Stats calculation in Datadog Connector.
  Consider implementing sampling in your pipeline prior to sending traces to Datadog Connector if you experience this.
