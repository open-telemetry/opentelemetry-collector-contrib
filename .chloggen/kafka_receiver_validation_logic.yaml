  Fixed bug where deprecated `topic` and `exclude_topic` fields for metrics, traces, and profiles
  were incorrectly checking logs configuration instead of their respective signal type's configuration.
  This prevented proper migration from deprecated fields unless logs.topics was empty.
  Also fixed validation error message typo for traces.exclude_topic and corrected profiles validation
  to check ExcludeTopic fields instead of Topic fields.
