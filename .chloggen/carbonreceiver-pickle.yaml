  The Pickle protocol is more efficient than plaintext protocol, it supports sending 
  metrics in batches. This enhancement allows the Carbon receiver to accept metrics sent using the
  Pickle protocol, improving compatibility with Carbon clients and enabling more efficient metric ingestion.
  Please note that this change also affects the receiver/wavefront component, The Parse interface (see carbonreceiver/parser.go) 
  has been improved to support binary data as input to handle Pickle data.
