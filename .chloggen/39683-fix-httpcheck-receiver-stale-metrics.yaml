  When the status code changes, the series for the previous status stops being exported.
  This is problematic with prometheus exporter's metric_expiration, as
  the stale value will continue to be reported for some time.

  To counter this, the new code will once export value 0 after the change to
  move the stale value to the correct value.

# If your change doesn't affect end users or the exported elements of any package,
# you should instead start your pull request title with [chore] or use the "Skip Changelog" label.
# Optional: The change log or logs in which this entry should be included.
