  This enhancement introduces the `ottl.GetLiteralValue` function to OTTL, enabling compile-time optimization for getters that 
  contain literal values. When a getter is identified as containing a literal value, OTTL functions can now access that value 
  at build time rather than runtime, improving performance for common use cases like pattern matching with static strings.
