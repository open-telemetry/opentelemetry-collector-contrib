  The azureeventhubreceiver now supports receiving custom metrics emitted by applications to Azure Insights and forwarded using Diagnostic Settings to Azure Event Hub.
  There's also on optional setting to aggregate received metrics into a single metric to keep the original name, instead of multiply the metrics by added suffixes `_total`, `_sum`, `_max` etc.
