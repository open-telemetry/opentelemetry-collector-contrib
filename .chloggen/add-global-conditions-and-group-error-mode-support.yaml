  Global conditions are now available for context-inferred structured configurations, allowing the use of fully 
  qualified paths. Additionally, a new configuration key called `error_mode` has been added to the context statements group. 
  This key determines how the processor reacts to errors that occur while processing that specific group of statements. 
  When provided, it overrides the top-level error mode, offering more granular control over error handling.
