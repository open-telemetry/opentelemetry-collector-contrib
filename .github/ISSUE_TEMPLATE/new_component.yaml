      description: "The OpenTelemetry Collector has a pluggable architecture that allows you to build your own [distribution](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/distributions/) with your own [custom components](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/building/) using the [OpenTelemetry Collector Builder](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/custom-collector/). You **don't need** to include your component in this repository to be able to use or distribute your component: you can just  host it in your own repository as a Go module and [add it to the OpenTelemetry registry](https://opentelemetry.io/ecosystem/registry/)."

      label: Code Owners
      description: Code owners are responsible for supporting the component, including triaging issues, reviewing PRs, and submitting bug fixes.
        Please list three or more OpenTelemetry members who will serve as code owners.
        One of them must be an approver or maintainer in this repository (it can be the same person as the sponsor).
        Having at least two code owners before opening the issue is strongly recommended. However, you may use the issue to try to find enough code owners for your component to meet the minimum required number of three.
    validations:
      required: true
  - type: input
    attributes:
      label: Sponsor (optional)
      description: "A sponsor is an approver who will be in charge of being the official reviewer of the code.
        Having a sponsor means that your use-case has been validated. If there are no sponsors yet for the component,
        it's fine: use the issue as a means to try to find a sponsor for your component. The sponsor must be from a different company than the issue author. If you are unable to find a sponsor, the component can still live in your own source repository and can be included in Collector distributions using the Collector builder."
