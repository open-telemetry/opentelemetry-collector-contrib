      label: Is this a vendor-specific component?
      description: A vendor-specific component directly interfaces with a vendor-specific API and is expected to be maintained by a representative of the same vendor.
      options:
        - label: This is a vendor-specific component
        - label: If this is a vendor-specific component, I am proposing to contribute and support it as a representative of the vendor.

    attributes:
      label: Code Owner(s)
      description: A code owner is responsible for supporting the component, including triaging issues, reviewing PRs, and submitting bug fixes.
        Please list one or more members or aspiring members of the OpenTelemetry project who will serve as code owners.
        For vendor-specific components, the code owner is required and must be a representative of the vendor.
        For non-vendor components, having a code owner is strongly recommended. However, you may use the issue to try to find a code owner for your component.
  - type: input
    attributes:
      label: Sponsor (optional)
      description: "A sponsor is an approver who will be in charge of being the official reviewer of the code.
        For vendor-specific components, it's good to have a volunteer sponsor. If you can't find one, we'll assign one in a round-robin fashion.
        For non-vendor components, having a sponsor means that your use-case has been validated.
        If there are no sponsors yet for the component, it's fine: use the issue as a means to try to find a sponsor for your component."
