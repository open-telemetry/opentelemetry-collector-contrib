      label: Building and distributing outside this repository
      description: "The OpenTelemetry Collector has a pluggable architecture that allows you to build your own [distribution](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/distributions/) with your own [custom components](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/building/) using the [OpenTelemetry Collector Builder](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/custom-collector/). You **don't need** to include your component in this repository to be able to use or distribute your component: you can just  host it in your own repository as a Go module and [add it to the OpenTelemetry registry](https://opentelemetry.io/ecosystem/registry/)."
      options:
        - label: I understand I can use and distribute my component outside of this repository.

      label: Example configuration for the component
      description: This will be used later on when creating `config.go` and added to README as well. See this receiver as an [example](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/jaegerreceiver#getting-started).

    attributes:
      label: Code Owner(s)
      description: A code owner is responsible for supporting the component, including triaging issues, reviewing PRs, and submitting bug fixes.
        Please list one or more members or aspiring members of the OpenTelemetry project who will serve as code owners.
        Having a code owner is strongly recommended. However, you may use the issue to try to find a code owner for your component.
  - type: input
    attributes:
      label: Sponsor (optional)
      description: "A sponsor is an approver who will be in charge of being the official reviewer of the code.
        Having a sponsor means that your use-case has been validated. If there are no sponsors yet for the component,
        it's fine: use the issue as a means to try to find a sponsor for your component. If you are unable to find a sponsor, the component can still live in your own source repository and can be included in Collector distributions using the Collector builder."
