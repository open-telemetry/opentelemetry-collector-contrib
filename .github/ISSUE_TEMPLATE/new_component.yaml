      label: Code Owner(s)
      description: A code owner is responsible for supporting the component, including triaging issues, reviewing PRs, and submitting bug fixes.
        Please list one or more members or aspiring members of the OpenTelemetry project who will serve as code owners.
        Having a code owner is strongly recommended. However, you may use the issue to try to find a code owner for your component.
  - type: input
    attributes:
      label: Sponsor (optional)
      description: "A sponsor is an approver who will be in charge of being the official reviewer of the code.
        Having a sponsor means that your use-case has been validated. If there are no sponsors yet for the component,
        it's fine: use the issue as a means to try to find a sponsor for your component. If you are unable to find a sponsor, the component can still live in your own source repository and can be included in Collector distributions using the Collector builder."
