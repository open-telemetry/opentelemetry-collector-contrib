  this change, we update the default client_id value to "otel-collector".
  
- `kafkametricsreceiver`: change default client_id to "otel-collector", deprecate "refresh_frequency" (#38411)
  The receiver now uses the "configkafka" package which consolidates
  common configuration structures and default values. As a result of
  this change, we update the default client_id value to "otel-collector",
  and deprecate "refresh_frequency" in favour of "metadata.refresh_interval".

### 💡 Enhancements 💡

- `spanmetricsconnector`: Add instrumentation scope to span metrics connector. (#23662)
  This change adds the instrumentation scope to the span metrics connector, which allows users to specify the instrumentation scope for the connector.
  Now, the connector has a new configuration option:
    - `include_instrumentation_scope`: A list of instrumentation scope names to include from the traces.
  
  The instrumentation scope name is the name of the instrumentation library that collected the span.
  
- `azuremonitorexporter`: support span links for traces for azure monitor exporter (#35855)
- `splunkhecreceiver`: Splunk HEC timestamp accepts nanoseconds, microseconds, milliseconds, and seconds epoch. (#36571)
- `farotranslator`: Add Faro translator package (#19180, #35319)
- `lokiexporter`: Add lokiexporter component to the contrib distribution (#38993)
- `oracledbreceiver`: Add support for additional read/write metrics (#37814)
  The following metrics are now available, all disabled by default:
  'physical reads direct', 'physical writes', 'physical writes direct',
  'physical read io requests' and 'physical write io requests' metrics'
  
- `tlscheckreceiver`: add `tlscheck.x509.san` attribute (#38872)
  Subject Alternative Name records are stored as an array on the metric.
  
- `prometheusremotewriteexporter`: Adds logic to convert from the internal OTEL Metrics unit format to Prometheus unit format and emit unit as part of Prometheus metadata. (#29452)

- `schemaprocessor`: Add functionality to transform metrics for the schema processor.
 (#38628)
  Adds functionality to transform metrics using the target schema version.
  
- `elasticsearchexporter`: Enable native frame symbolization for Universal Profiling via the symbolization queue indices. (#38577)
- `hostmetricsreceiver`: Reduced the cost of retrieving number of threads and parent process ID on Windows. Disable the featuregate `hostmetrics.process.onWindowsUseNewGetProcesses` to fallback to the previous implementation.
 (#32947, #38589)
- `prometheusremotewritereciever`: Add help ref attribute to metric (#37277)
- `hostmetricsreceiver`: Reduced the CPU cost of collecting the `process.handles` metric on Windows. (#38886)
  Instead of using WMI to retrieve the number of opened handles by each process
  the scraper now uses the GetProcessHandleCount Win32 API which results in
  reduced CPU usage when the metric `process.handles` is enabled.
  
- `pkg/ottl`: Enhance the Decode OTTL function to support all flavors of Base64 (#38854)
- `rabbitmqreceiver`: Enhance the RabbitMQ receiver to collect and report additional node-level metrics: `rabbitmq.node.disk_free`, `rabbitmq.node.disk_free_limit`, `rabbitmq.node.disk_free_alarm`, `rabbitmq.node.disk_free_details.rate`, `rabbitmq.node.mem_used`, `rabbitmq.node.mem_limit`, `rabbitmq.node.mem_alarm`, `rabbitmq.node.mem_used_details.rate`, `rabbitmq.node.fd_used`, `rabbitmq.node.fd_total`, `rabbitmq.node.fd_used_details.rate`, `rabbitmq.node.sockets_used`, `rabbitmq.node.sockets_total`, `rabbitmq.node.sockets_used_details.rate`, `rabbitmq.node.proc_used`, `rabbitmq.node.proc_total`, `rabbitmq.node.proc_used_details.rate`. These provide additional observability into the state and resource usage of RabbitMQ nodes. (#38976)
- `rabbitmqreceiver`: Enhance the RabbitMQ receiver to collect and report additional node-level metrics across multiple categories. These include metrics related to memory, file descriptors, sockets, processes, disk, uptime, scheduling, garbage collection (GC), I/O, message store, connections, clustering, configuration, application info, and context switches. This significantly improves visibility into the performance, state, and resource usage of RabbitMQ nodes. (#38997)
- `resourcedetection`: Adding the os.version resource attribute to system resourcedetection processor (#38087)
- `prometheusremotewritereciever`: Separate timeseries with the same labels are now translated into the same OTLP metric. (#37791)
  timeseries that belongs to the same metric should be added to the same datapoints slice.
- `prometheusremotewritereceiver`: Use Created Timestamps to populate Datapoint's StartTimeUnixNano (#37277)
- `workflow`: Remove path parts from component label suffixes (#38527)
- `sqlserverreceiver`: support sqlserverreceiver to record every executing query (#36462)
  We introduced Query Sample collection in this PR. The scraper will record all the currently 
  executing queries once (in most case) and report related metrics. With this, user will be 
  able to see what queries got executed and can combine with the Top Query to get more insights 
  on troubleshooting and fine tuning.
  
- `sqlserverreceiver`: Support query-level log collection (#36462)
  Added top query (most CPU time consumed) collection. The query will gather the queries took most of the time during the last
  query interval and report related metrics. The number of queries can be configured. This will enable user to have better
  understanding on what is going on with the database. This enhancement empowers users to not only monitor but also actively 
  manage and optimize their MSSQL database performance based on real usage patterns.
  
- `opampsupervisor`: Allow controlling Collectors that don't include the nopreceiver and nopexporer (#38809)
  This requires Collectors built with Collector API v0.122.0+. The nopreceiver
  and nopexporter will continue to be supported for a few releases, after which
  only v0.122.0+ will be supported.
  
- `opampsupervisor`: Report the reception of an unexpected UID during bootstrapping (#29864)

### 🧰 Bug fixes 🧰

- `metricstarttimeprocessor`: Add reset detection for histograms (#38582)
- `prometheusremotewriteexporter`: Disallow users from setting compression type other than snappy (#37232)
  This change ensures that only the snappy compression type can be set, as required by the Prometheus Remote Write protocol. 
  
- `awsecscontainermetrics`: Ensure that the storage.read_bytes and storage.write_bytes metrics include i/o counts from all devices (#38301)
- `receiver/sqlserver`: the current metric scraper would report error when parsing value, the value was parsed as int but actually it should be a float (#38823)
- `redisstorageextension`: fix missing redis prefix in Batch method (#38877)
- `receiver/sqlserver`: Ensure all enabled metrics are emitted (#38839)
- `kafkareceiver`: make calls to error backoff thread-safe and add logging (#38941)
- `awsfirehosereceiver`: Fixes unmarshal error when request is larger than the buffer limit of bufio.Scanner (#38736)
- `axw:prometheusremotewritereceiver-fix-tests`: wait for listening port to be closed before shutting down receiver (#38705)
- `receiver/sqlserver`: Remove warning that `server.address` and `server.port` resource attributes will be enabled (#38831)
  There is no intention of enabling these resource attributes by default,
  this change is to simply remove the warning.
  The `server.address` and `server.port` resource attributes were, and still are,
  disabled by default.
  
- `awscloudwatchmetricstreamsencodingextension`: Return errors when extracting the metrics from the record instead of logging them. (#38596)
- `tcpcheckreceiver`: Fixed typo in "Metric configuration". (#38889)
- `pkg/stanza`: Add retries when calls to retrieve Windows event via `EvtNext` fail with error RPC_S_INVALID_BOUND (1734). (#38149)
  Whenever large events were read in by the Windows event log receiver, via the stanza input operator,
  the collector would fail with error RPC_S_INVALID_BOUND (1734). Now the operator tries to workaround
  this issue by reducing the number of events read on each attempt.

## v0.122.0

### 🛑 Breaking changes 🛑

- `deltatocumulative`: removes legacy and clean up existing metrics (#38079)
  renamed:
    - `otelcol_deltatocumulative.datapoints.processed` to `otelcol_deltatocumulative_datapoints`
    - `otelcol_deltatocumulative.datapoints.dropped` to `otelcol_deltatocumulative_datapoints{error="..."}`
    - `otelcol_deltatocumulative.max_stale` to `otelcol_deltatocumulative_max_stale`
    - `otelcol_deltatocumulative.streams.limit` to `otelcol_deltatocumulative_streams_limit`
    - `otelcol_deltatocumulative.streams.tracked` to `otelcol_deltatocumulative_streams_tracked`
  removed (already unused):
    - `otelcol_deltatocumulative.datapoints.linear`
    - `otelcol_deltatocumulative.streams.tracked.linear`
    - `otelcol_deltatocumulative.streams.evicted`
    - `otelcol_deltatocumulative.gaps.length`
  
- `elasticsearchexporter`: Dynamically route documents by default unless `{logs,metrics,traces}_index` is non-empty (#38361)
  Overhaul in document routing. Deprecate and make `{logs,metrics,traces}_dynamic_index` config no-op. Config validation error on `{logs,metrics,traces}_dynamic_index::enabled` and `{logs,metrics,traces}_index` set at the same time, as users who rely on dynamic index should not set `{logs,metrics,traces}_index`. Remove `elasticsearch.index.{prefix,suffix}` handling. Replace it with `elasticsearch.index` handling that uses attribute value as index directly. Users rely on the previously supported `elasticsearch.index.prefix` and `elasticsearch.index.suffix` should migrate to a transform processor that sets `elasticsearch.index`. Fix a bug where receiver-based routing overwrites data_stream.dataset.
- `elasticsearchexporter`: Change default `mapping::mode` config to `otel` (#37241)
  The new default, OTel mapping mode, requires Elasticsearch 8.12+. To retain the old behavior, explicitly set `mapping::mode` to `none`.
- `dbstorageextension`: Change SQLite driver to non-CGO version (#35280)
  New SQLite driver has incompatible set of options and users should carefully review used driver options (if any) on update
  Migration guide and available driver options are added to component documentation
  
- `kafkatopicsobserver`: Remove session_timeout and heartbeat_interval config (#38414)
  These attributes are only relevant to Kafka consumers.
- `examples/demo`: Remove examples/demo (#38488)
  The other examples are sufficient, and there exists the more comprehensive OpenTelemetry Demo.
  
- `receiver/sqlserverreceiver`: SQL Server receiver now requires a positive serial number for X509 certificates. (#38099)
  See known issues in README of `receiver/sqlserverreceiver` for more information.

## v0.121.0

### 🛑 Breaking changes 🛑

- `telemetrygen`: Update attribute of generated traces from `net.peer.ip` to `net.sock.peer.addr` to bring it in line with new semconv. (#38043)
- `awss3exporter`: Replaced the `s3_partition` option with `s3_partition_format` to provide more flexibility to users. (#37915, #37503)
  Users can provide custom file partitions using [strftime](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/strftime.3.html) formatting.
  The default value of `year=%Y/month=%m/day=%d/hour=%H/minute=%M` matches the older pattern (with `s3_partition: minute`)
  
  If users do not provide a value for `s3_prefix`, the exporter will not create a `/` folder in the bucket.
  
- `elasticsearchexporter`: drop support for metrics for none, raw, and bodymap mapping modes (#37928)
  Metrics support is in development, and was added for "ecs" and "otel" mapping modes.
  Support was unintentionally added for the other mapping modes, defaulting to the same
  behaviour as "ecs" mode. While metrics support is still in development, drop support
  from these mapping modes and require users to use the intended mapping modes.
  
- `awscontainerinsightreceiver`: Remove high cardinality attribute `Timestamp` from metrics generated by `awscontainerinsightreceiver` (#35861)
- `failoverconnector`: Refactors the failover logic and changes the retry mechanism to sample data points (#38064)
- `processor/k8sattributes`: Move k8sattr.fieldExtractConfigRegex.disallow feature gate to stable (#25128)
- `signalfxexporter`: Remove the deprecated configuration option `translation_rules` (#35332)
  Please use processors to handle desired metric transformations instead. Find migration guidance in the
  [translation rules migration guide](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/exporter/signalfxexporter/docs/translation_rules_migration_guide.md).
  
- `signaltometricsconnector`: `get` OTTL function is removed and expressions are now parsed using `ParseValueExpression` (#38098)

### 🚩 Deprecations 🚩

- `elasticsearchexporter`: Deprecate `batcher::min_size_items` and `batcher::max_size_items` in favor of `batcher::min_size` and `batcher::max_size`. (#38243)
- `prometheusreceiver`: Deprecate metric start time adjustment in the prometheus receiver. It is being replaced by the metricstarttime processor. (#37186)
  Start time adjustment is still enabled by default. To disable it, enable the | receiver.prometheusreceiver.RemoveStartTimeAdjustment feature gate.

### 🚀 New components 🚀

- `windowsservicereceiver`: Adding a wireframe for a new receiver: windowsservicereceiver (#31377)
- `azureblobexporter`: Add new exporter for sending telemetry to Azure Storage Blob (#35717)

## v0.120.1

### 🧰 Bug fixes 🧰

- `receiver/prometheus`: Fix Collector failing to start up if Prometheus receiver is present in config without 'fallback_scrape_protocol'. (#38018)

## v0.120.0

### 🛑 Breaking changes 🛑

- `receiver/prometheus`: Prometheus receiver now uses scrapers in Prometheus 3.0. (#36873)
  There are a number of breaking changes in Prometheus 3.0. Learn more about those changes and migration guide on https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/migration/.
  As a result of [adding support for UTF-8 names](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/migration/#utf-8-names),
  the metrics and labels containing UTF-8 characters are no longer escaped. Consequently, the dots (.) in internal
  collector metrics and resource attributes scraped by Prometheus are no longer replaced with underscores (_) unless you follow the migration guide
  and set `metric_name_validation_scheme` to `legacy` in the Prometheus receiver config.
    - The `service_name`, `service_instance_id`, and `service_version` resource attributes are now scraped as 
      `service.name`, `service.instance.id`, and `service.version`, respectively.
    - The following metrics containing dots reported by several components are no longer escaped:
      - `filter` processor:

### 💡 Enhancements 💡

- `elasticsearchexporter`: Syncs support for compression level on elasticsearch exporter with confighttp. The default compression level is 1 if not set. (#37260)
- `processor/transformprocessor`: Add support for global conditions and error mode overrides. (#29017)
  Global conditions are now available for context-inferred structured configurations, allowing the use of fully 
  qualified paths. Additionally, a new configuration key called `error_mode` has been added to the context statements group. 
  This key determines how the processor reacts to errors that occur while processing that specific group of statements. 
  When provided, it overrides the top-level error mode, offering more granular control over error handling.
  
- `pkg/stanza`: Allow users to configure initial buffer size (#37786)
- `vcenterreceiver`: Adds three more vCenter virtual machine performance metrics (#37488)
- `k8sclusterreceiver`: Adds new descriptive attributes/metadata to the k8s.namespace and the container entity emitted from k8sclusterreceiver. (#37580)
  - Adds the following attributes to k8s.namespace entity:
    - k8s.namespace.phase: The phase of a namespace indicates where the namespace is in its lifecycle. E.g. 'active', 'terminating'
    - k8s.namespace.creation_timestamp: The time when the namespace object was created.
  - Adds the following attributes to container entity:
    - container.creation_timestamp: The time when the container was started. Only available if container is either in 'running' or 'terminated' state.
  
- `splunkenterprisereceiver`: Added a new `splunk.health` metric. (#36695)
- `pkg/ottl`: Introduce ToLowerCase converter function (#32942)

- `elasticsearchexporter`: Add profiles support to elasticsearch exporter (#37567)
- `googlecloudmonitoringreceiver`: support use [monitoring filters](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/v3/filters) to filter metrics (#36898)
- `awsfirehosereceiver`: Refactor unmarshallers to implement pdata unmarshaler interfaces (#37361)
- `githubreceiver`: add support for GitHub Actions workflow run events using deterministic Trace and Root Span IDs. (#37578)
- `pkg/translator/jaeger/internal/jaeger`: Remove jaeger model/converter/thrift/jaeger dependency (#37820)
- `pkg/translator/zipkin/internal/zipkin`: Remove jaeger model/converter/thrift/zipkin dependency (#37795)
- `extension/oauth2clientauth`: Add `expiry_buffer` config to `oauth2client` extension, allowing token refresh before expiration with a default buffer of 5 minutes. (#35148)
  - Prevents authentication failures by refreshing the token early.
  - The default expiry buffer is set to 5 minutes, and users can adjust it as needed.
  
- `datadogexporter`: Add a gauge metric datadog.otel.gateway which is 1 if the collector is used as a gateway or 0 otherwise. (#37499)
- `pkg/ottl`: Introduce ToCamelCase converter function (#32942)
- `googlecloudpubsubreceiver`: Turn noisy `warn` log about Pub/Sub servers into `debug`, and turn the reset count into a metric (#37571)
  The receiver uses the Google Cloud Pub/Sub StreamingPull API and keeps a open connection. The Pub/Sub servers
  recurrently close the connection after a time period to avoid a long-running sticky connection. Before the
  receiver logged `warn` log lines everytime this happened. These log lines are moved to debug so that fleets with
  lots of collectors with the receiver don't span logs at warn level. To keep track of the resets, whenever a
  connection reset happens a `otelcol_receiver_googlecloudpubsub_stream_restarts` metric is increased by one.
  
- `processor/redaction`: Introduce 'allowed_values' parameter for allowed values of attributes (#35840)
- `exporter/logzioexporter`: Remove dependency on Jaeger pkg/cache (#37833)
- `routingconnector`: Avoid unnecessary copy of the data in routing connector (#37946)

- `syslogreceiver`: Support setting `on_error` config for syslog receiver. (#36906)
- `processor/tailsampling`: Adds support for optionally recording the policy (and any composite policy) associated with an inclusive tail processor sampling decision. 
This functionality is disabled by default, you can enable it by passing the following feature flag to the collector: `+processor.tailsamplingprocessor.recordpolicy`
 (#35180)
- `tailsamplingprocessor`: makes the `numeric_attribute` more flexible and allows to set only `min_value` or `max_value`, without the need to set both (#37328)
  This is useful to have simple configurations like these:
  ```
  {
    type: numeric_attribute,
    numeric_attribute: {
      key: http.status_code,
      min_value: 400
    }
  }
  ```
  
- `testbed`: Include the specified resource limits for CPU and memory in the benchmark results (#36720)
- `stefexporter`: Add basic STEF exporter implementation (#37759)
- `receiver/zipkinreceiver`: Remove zipkinreceiver dependency on Jaeger (#37795)

 (#19363, #24399, #15277)
- `awscontainerinsightreceiver`: Fix race condition in shutdown of AWS Container Insight receiver (#37695)

## v0.119.0

### 🛑 Breaking changes 🛑

- `receiver/cloudfoundry`: Promote `cloudfoundry.resourceAttributes.allow` feature gate to beta (#34824)
  The `cloudfoundry.resourceAttributes.allow` feature gate is now enabled by default.
  
- `datadogexporter`: Remove stable feature gate `exporter.datadog.hostname.preview` (#37561)
- `exporter/prometheusremotewrite`: Change `exporter.prometheusremotewriteexporter.deprecateCreatedMetric` feature gate from Beta to Stable version. (#35003)
  The `export_created_metric` configuration parameter is now permanently deprecated.
- `elasticsearchexporter`: Consistently store the structured body of logs and events in `body.structured` in `otel` mode (#37387)
- `solacereceiver`: Update validation step to allow only one auth method. (#36386)

### 🚩 Deprecations 🚩

  - "`access_token_passthrough` is deprecated."
  - "Please enable include_metadata in the receiver and add the following config to the batch processor:"
  ```yaml
  batch:
    metadata_keys: [X-Sf-Token]
  ```
  

### 🚀 New components 🚀

- `envoyalsreceiver`: Add a new receiver for the Envoy ALS (Access Log Service). (#36464)
- `metricstarttimeprocessor`: Add the initial skeleton for the metricsstarttimeprocessor (#37186)
  The component is still in development and is not ready for use.
- `exporter/sematext`: Add a new component for exporting metrics and logs to Sematext (#36465)

### 💡 Enhancements 💡

- `awss3exporter`: Add support for S3 Storgeclass (#35173)
- `processor/transformprocessor`: Add support for flat configuration style. (#29017)
  The flat configuration style allows users to configure statements by providing a list of statements instead of a
  structured configuration map. The statement's context is expressed by adding the context's name prefix to path names,
  which are used to infer and to select the appropriate context for the statement.
  
- `httpcheckreceiver`: Added support for specifying multiple endpoints in the `httpcheckreceiver` using the `endpoints` field. Users can now monitor multiple URLs with a single configuration block, improving flexibility and reducing redundancy. (#37121)
- `signaltometricsconnector`: Move signal to metrics connector to alpha stability (#35930)
- `exporter/clickhouse`: Adding missing examples of DDL created by the clickhouse exporter (#35903)
- `opampsupervisor`: add support for headers configuration for reporting own telemetry (#37353)
- `opampsupervisor`: report own metrics via OTLP instead of prometheus receiver (#37346)
- `resourcedetectionprocessor`: Expose additional configuration parameters for the AWS metadata client used by the EC2 detector (#35936)
  In some cases, you might need to change the behavior of the AWS metadata client from the [standard retryer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/v2/developer-guide/configure-retries-timeouts.html)
  
  By default, the client retries 3 times with a max backoff delay of 20s.
  
  We offer a limited set of options to override those defaults specifically, such that you can set the client to retry 10 times, for up to 5 minutes, for example:
  ```yaml
  processors:
    resourcedetection/ec2:
      detectors: ["ec2"]
      ec2:
        max_attempts: 10
        max_backoff: 5m
  ```
  
- `cumulativetodeltaprocessor`: Add metric type filter for cumulativetodelta processor (#33673)
- `datadogconnector`: Support obfuscating sql queries in APM stats (#37457)
  Ensure that feature flags "enable_receive_resource_spans_v2" and "enable_operation_and_resource_name_logic_v2"
  are also enabled on both Datadog Exporter and Datadog Connector so that span attributes are properly
  mapped to span type and span resource in Datadog APM; otherwise spans and apm stats may not be 
  obfuscated and attributes on stats payloads may not match traces.
  See https://docs.datadoghq.com/opentelemetry/schema_semantics/semantic_mapping/?tab=datadogexporter#mapping-opentelemetry-database-system-type-to-datadog-span-type
  
  NOTE: Long/complex SQL queries may cause a performance impact on APM Stats calculation in Datadog Connector.
  Consider implementing sampling in your pipeline prior to sending traces to Datadog Connector if you experience this.
  
- `resourcedetectionprocessor`: Add `fail_on_missing_metadata` option on EC2 detector (#35936)
  If the EC2 metadata endpoint is unavailable, the EC2 detector by default ignores the error.
  By setting `fail_on_missing_metadata` to true on the detector, the user will now trigger an error explicitly,
  which will stop the collector from starting.
  
- `elasticsearchexporter`: Group data points into a single document even if they are from different but equal resources (#37509)
  This may prevent document rejections in case the same batch contains different resources or scopes that have the same set of attributes
- `elasticsearchexporter`: Add config `logs_dynamic_id` to dynamically set the document ID of log records using log record attribute `elasticsearch.document_id` (#36882)
- `elasticsearchexporter`: Declare MutatesData: false (#37234)
  When multiple exporters are used, the collector doesn't need to clone the incoming data anymore
- `resourcedetectionprocessor`: The `gcp` resource detector will now detect resource attributes identifying a GCE instance's managed instance group. (#36142)
- `jaegerreceiver`: Log the endpoints of different servers started by jaegerreceiver (#36961)
  This change logs the endpoints of different servers started by jaegerreceiver. It simplifies debugging by ensuring log messages match configuration settings.
  
- `githubgen`: Switch over all usages of githubgen to the new tool location, since the old tool was deprecated (#37412, #37294)
- `hostmetrics/process`: Added support for tracking process.uptime (#36667)
- `netflowreceiver`: Adds the implementation of the netflow receiver (#32732)
  The receiver now supports receiving NetFlow v5, NetFow v9, IPFIX, and sFlow v5 logs.
- `googlecloudpubsubreceiver`: Added support for encoding extensions. (#37109)

### 🧰 Bug fixes 🧰

- `deltatocumulativeprocessor`: In order to cap number of histogram buckets take the min of desired scale across negative and positive buckets instead of the max (#37416)
- `filelogreceiver`: Fix issue where flushed tokens could be truncated. (#35042)
- `connector/routing`: Fix config validation with context other than `resource` (#37410)
- `k8sattributesprocessor`: Wait for the other informers to complete their initial sync before starting the pod informers (#37056)
- `metricsgenerationprocessor`: Generated metric name may not match metric being scaled (#37474)
- `otlpjsonfilereceiver`: Include file attributes and append it to the log record (#36641)
- `routingconnector`: The connector splits the original payload so that it may be emitted in parts to each route. (#37390)
- `pkg/stanza`: Fix default source identifier in recombine operator (#37210)
  Its default value is now aligned with the semantic conventions: `attributes["log.file.path"]`
  
- `tailsamplingprocessor`: Fixed sampling decision metrics `otelcol_processor_tail_sampling_sampling_trace_dropped_too_early` and `otelcol_processor_tail_sampling_sampling_policy_evaluation_error_total`, these were sometimes overcounted. (#37212)
  As a result of this change non-zero values of `otelcol_processor_tail_sampling_sampling_trace_dropped_too_early`
  and `otelcol_processor_tail_sampling_sampling_policy_evaluation_error_total` metrics will be lower.
  Before this fix, errors got counted several times depending on the amount of traces being processed
  that tick and where in the batch the error happened.
  Zero values are unaffected.
  
- `signalfxexporter`: Warn on dropping metric data points when they have more than allowed dimension count (#37484)
  The SignalFx exporter drops metric data points if they have more than 36 dimensions.
  Currently, the exporter logs at debug level when this occurs.
  With this change, the exporter will log at the warning level.

  The retain operator should propagate the severity field like it does with timestamps. 
  
- `pkg/stanza`: Handle error of callback function of `ParserOperator.ProcessWithCallback` (#35769)
  `ProcessWithCallback` of `ParserOperator` first calls the `ParseWith` method
  which properly handles errors with `HandleEntryError`.
  Then the callback function is called and its returned error should also
  be handled by the `HandleEntryError` ensuring a consistent experience.

- `azureblobreceiver`: adds support for using azidentity default auth, enabling the use of Azure Managed Identities, e.g. Workload Identities on AKS (#35636)
  This change allows to use authentication type "default", which makes the receiver use azidentity default Credentials, 
  which automatically picks up, identities assigned to e.g. a container or a VirtualMachine

### 🧰 Bug fixes 🧰

- `metricstransform`: The previously removed functionality of aggregating against an empty label set is restored. (#34430)
- `datadogreceiver`: Use `Check` name from Service Check structure as metric name rather than hardcoded string `service_check` (#35718)
- `azuredataexplorerexporter`: Fix compression type for Azure Data Explorer exporter by adding the compression type in ingestion properties. (#35353)
- `telemetrygen`: ensure validate is called (#35745)
- `deltatocumulative`: fix meter panic on startup (#35685)
  properly constructs the TelemetryBuilder, so it does not panic on startup, rendering the entire component unusable
- `elasticsearchexporter`: Log and drop invalid metrics instead of returning error to avoid upstream retries (#35740)
- `elasticsearchexporter`: Preserve attribute names and metric names on prefix conflict in OTel mapping mode (#35651)
  e.g. if there are attributes "a" and "a.b", they should be sent to Elasticsearch as is, instead of "a.value" and "a.b", in OTel mapping mode
- `elasticsearchexporter`: Make OTel mapping mode send to data streams only (#35839)
  This prevents auto creating regular indices in OTel mapping mode due to a race condition in Elasticsearch where otel-data index templates are not ready.
- `elasticsearchexporter`: Sanitize datastream routing fields (#34285)
  Sanitize the dataset and namespace fields according to https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/ecs/current/ecs-data_stream.html.
- `oidcauthextension`: Fix a goroutine leak during shutdown. (#30438)
  A goroutine leak was found in oidcauthextension. The goroutine leak was caused by the oidcauthextension not closing the idle connections in the client and transport.
  
- `filelogreceiver`: Supports `add_metadata_from_filepath` for Windows filepaths (#35558)
- `filelogreceiver`: Suppress errors on EBADF when unlocking files. (#35706)
  This error is harmless and happens regularly when delete_after_read is set. This is because we acquire the lock right at the start of the ReadToEnd function and then defer the unlock, but that function also performs the delete. So, by the time it returns and the defer runs the file descriptor is no longer valid.
- `kafkareceiver`: Fixes issue causing kafkareceiver to block during Shutdown(). (#30789)
- `hostmetrics receiver`: Fix duplicate filesystem metrics (#34635, #34512)
  The hostmetrics exposes duplicate metrics of identical mounts exposed in namespaces. The duplication causes errors in exporters that are sensitive to duplicate metrics. We can safely drop the duplicates as the metrics should be exactly the same.
- `pkg/translator/prometheusremotewrite`: Fix metric comparison func in prom translation layer (#35741)
- `pkg/ottl`: Allow indexing string slice type (#29441)
- `mysqlreceiver`: Add replica metric support for versions of MySQL earlier than 8.0.22. (#35217)

- `datadogreceiver`: Changes response message for `/api/v1/series` and `/api/v2/series` 202 response to be JSON and on par with Datadog API spec (#35743)

## v0.111.0

### 🛑 Breaking changes 🛑

- `instanaexporter`: Remove deprecated instanaexporter (#35367)
  Use the `otlp` exporter instead as explained in IBM's [documentation](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/instana-observability/current?topic=opentelemetry-sending-data-instana-backend).
- `elasticsearchexporter`: Drop cumulative temporality histogram and exponential histogram (#35442)
  Cumulative temporality histogram and exponential histogram are not supported by Elasticsearch. Use cumulativetodeltaprocessor to convert cumulative temporality to delta temporality.
- `elasticsearchexporter`: Implement receiver-based routing under *_dynamic_index config (#34246)
- `config`: Move component.UseLocalHostAsDefaultHost feature gate to stable. (#35569)
- `metricsgenerationprocessor`: Generate metrics even when the second metric's value is 0 (#35533)
- `signalfxexporter`: Do not exclude the metric `container.memory.working_set` (#35475)
- `sqlqueryreceiver`: Fail if value for log column in result set is missing, collect errors (#35068)
- `windowseventlogreceiver`: The 'raw' flag no longer suppresses rendering info. (#34720)
  Previously, this flag controlled two behaviors simultaneously:
    1. Whether or not the body of the log record was an XML string or structured object.
    2. Whether or not rendering info was resolved.
  A separate 'suppress_rendering_info' option now controls rendering info resolution.
  This is considered a breaking change because users setting only the 'raw' flag without also setting the
  new 'suppress_rendering_info' flag may see a performance decrease along with more detailed events.

## v0.109.0

### 🛑 Breaking changes 🛑

- `clickhouseexporter`: Upgrade trace SpanKind and StatusCode string values (#34799)
  This change updates the output of the trace SpanKind and StatusCode fields to be consistent
  with the specification's enum values. While this change will not break any deployments, it may affect
  queries dependent on the old enum names.
  
  For more details on old->new values, see this related PR:
  https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/pull/6250
  
- `spanmetricsconnector`: Improve consistency between metrics generated by spanmetricsconnector. Added traces.span.metrics as default namespace (#33227, #32818)
  Default namespace for the generated metrics is traces.span.metrics now. | The deprecated metrics are: calls, duration and events. | The feature flag connector.spanmetrics.legacyMetricNames was added to revert the behavior.
- `servicegraphconnector`: Fix histogram metrics miss unit (#34511)
  All metrics will remove the suffix `_seconds`. It will not introduce breaking change if users use | `prometheusexporter` or `prometheusremotewriteexporter` to exporter metrics in pipeline. | In some cases, like using `clickhouseexporter`(save data in native OTLP format), it will be a breaking change. | Users can use `transformprocessor` to add back this suffix.
- `gitproviderreceiver`: The Git Provider Receiver has been renamed to GitHub Receiver. (#34731)
  This rename was to better match the OpenTelemetry semantic convention changes in v1.27.0
  and allows for Traces and Log signals to be added to this component. Traces
  as mentioned in issue #27460 will be added in a future release to this component.
  
- `ottl`: Remove tracing from OTTL due to performance concerns (#34910)
- `vcenterreceiver`: Updated units on several metrics to be more in line with documented semantics. (#34946)
  The following are the metrics with their respective unit changes:
    - vcenter.datacenter.cpu.limit ({MHz} -> MHz)
    - vcenter.cluster.cpu.limit ({MHz} -> MHz)
    - vcenter.cluster.cpu.effective ({MHz} -> MHz)
    - vcenter.cluster.vsan.operations ({operations/sec} -> {operations/s})
    - vcenter.cluster.vsan.congestions ({congestions/sec} -> {congestions/s})
    - vcenter.host.network.packet.error.rate ({errors/sec} -> {errors/s})
    - vcenter.host.network.packet.rate ({packets/sec} -> {packets/s})
    - vcenter.host.network.packet.drop.rate ({packets/sec} -> {packets/s})
    - vcenter.host.vsan.operations ({operations/sec} -> {operations/s})
    - vcenter.host.vsan.congestions ({congestions/sec} -> {congestions/s})
    - vcenter.resource_pool.cpu.usage ({MHz} -> MHz)
    - vcenter.vm.network.throughput (By/sec -> By/s)
    - vcenter.vm.network.packet.rate ({packets/sec} -> {packets/s})
    - vcenter.vm.vsan.operations ({operations/sec} -> {operations/s})

- `elasticsearchexporter`: Change default retry.retry_on_status to [429] (#32584)
  To retain the previous behavior, set retry.retry_on_status to `[429, 500, 502, 503, 504]`.
- `gitproviderreceiver`: Update metric names and attributes to match the newest Semantic Conventions for VCS. (#34278)
  Attribute Changes:
    - `branch.name` is now `ref.name`
    - Added a `ref.type` attribute
    - `pull_request.state` is now `change.state`
    - `git.vendor.name` is now `vcs.vendor.name`
  Metric Changes:

  Following is the list of affected metrics which will now only report a single datapoint per set of unique attribute values.
  - vcenter.host.cpu.reserved
  - vcenter.host.disk.latency.avg
  - vcenter.host.disk.latency.max
  - vcenter.host.disk.throughput
  - vcenter.host.network.packet.drop.rate
  - vcenter.host.network.packet.error.rate
  - vcenter.host.network.packet.rate
  - vcenter.host.network.throughput
  - vcenter.host.network.usage

## v0.107.0

This release fixes CVE-2024-42368 on the `bearerauthtokenextension` (#34516)

### 🛑 Breaking changes 🛑

- `clickhouseexporter`: Add `compress` option to ClickHouse exporter, with default value of `lz4` (#34365)
  This change adds a new `compress` option to the config field and enables it by default.
  Prior to this change, compression was not enabled by default.
  The only way to enable compression prior to this change was via the DSN URL.
  With this change, `lz4` compression will be enabled by default.
  The list of valid options is provided by the underlying `clickhouse-go` driver.
  While this change is marked as breaking, there should be no effect to existing deployments by enabling compression.
  Compression should improve network performance on most deployments that have a remote ClickHouse server.

- `elasticsearchreceiver`: Enable more index metrics by default (#34396)
  This enables the following metrics by default: 
  `elasticsearch.index.documents`
  `elasticsearch.index.operations.merge.current`
  `elasticsearch.index.segments.count`
  To preserve previous behavior, update your Elasticsearch receiver configuration to disable these metrics.
- `vcenterreceiver`: Enables all of the vSAN metrics by default. (#34409)
  The following metrics will be enabled by default now:
    - vcenter.cluster.vsan.throughput
    - vcenter.cluster.vsan.operations
    - vcenter.cluster.vsan.latency.avg
    - vcenter.cluster.vsan.congestions
    - vcenter.host.vsan.throughput
    - vcenter.host.vsan.operations
    - vcenter.host.vsan.latency.avg
    - vcenter.host.vsan.congestions

    - vcenter.vm.vsan.throughput
    - vcenter.vm.vsan.operations
    - vcenter.vm.vsan.latency.avg
  

### 🚩 Deprecations 🚩

- `exporter/datadog`: Deprecates `logs::dump_payloads` since it is invalid with the Datadog Agent logs pipeline, which will be enabled by default in the v0.108.0 release. (#34490)

### 🚀 New components 🚀

- `logdedupprocessor`: Add new logdedupprocessor processor that deduplicates log entries. (#34118)
- `coralogixprocessor`: creating new component for coralogix features (#33090)
- `googlecloudmonitoringreceiver`: Adding new component - [Google Cloud monitoring](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/metrics_gcp) receiver to fetch GCP Cloud Metrics and transform to OpenTelemetry compatible format. (#33762)

### 💡 Enhancements 💡

- `awsemfexporter`: AWS EMF Exporter to update ApplicationSignals log group name and namespace, and adjust AWS service name prefix logic in spans (#33798)
- `azureeventhubreceiver`: Added traces support in azureeventhubreceiver (#33583)
- `exporter/prometheusremotewrite`: Reduce unnecessary memory allocation by removing buffer that was not used by Snappy encoding function. (#34273)

- `processor/k8sattributes`: Add support for `container.image.repo_digests` metadata (#34029)
- `datadogconnector`: Move feature gate `connector.datadogconnector.NativeIngest` to beta (#34549)
  When this feature gate is enabled (default), the datadog connector uses the new API to produce APM stats under the hood. | The new API has better throughput when your spans have many attributes (especially container related attributes). Functional-wise the new API should have no user-facing change compared to the old API. | However if you observe any unexpected behaviors, you can disable this feature gate to revert to the old stats processing APIs.
- `elasticsearchexporter`: Add opt-in support for the experimental `batcher` config (#32377)
  By enabling (or explicitly disabling) the batcher, the Elasticsearch exporter's
  existing batching/buffering logic will be disabled, and the batch sender will be used.
  
- `elasticsearchexporter`: Add summary support for metrics (#34560)
- `hostmetricsreceiver`: add reporting interval to entity event (#34240)

### 🧰 Bug fixes 🧰

- `configauth`: Fix unmarshaling of authentication in HTTP servers. (#34325)
  This brings in a bug fix from the core collector. See https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/issues/10750.
- `docker_observer`: Change default endpoint for `docker_observer` on Windows to `npipe:////./pipe/docker_engine` (#34358)
- `pkg/translator/jaeger`: Change the translation to jaeger spans to match semantic conventions. (#34368)
  `otel.library.name` is deprecated and replaced by `otel.scope.name`
  `otel.library.version` is deprecated and replaced by `otel.scope.version`
  
- `pkg/stanza`: Ensure that errors from `Process` and `Write` do not break for loops (#34295)
- `cmd/opampsupervisor`: Start even if the OpAMP server cannot be contacted, and continually retry connecting. (#33408, #33799)
- `cmd/opampsupervisor`: Write the generated effective config and agent log files to the user-defined storage directory. (#34341)
- `azuremonitorreceiver`: Add Azure China as a `cloud` option. (#34315)
- `postgresqlreceiver`: Support unix socket based replication by handling null values in the client_addr field (#33107)
- `splunkhecexporter`: Copy the bytes to be placed in the request body to avoid corruption on reuse (#34357)
  This bug is a manifestation of https://github.com/golang/go/issues/51907.
  Under high load, the pool of buffers used to send requests is reused enough
  that the same buffer is used concurrently to process data and be sent as request body.
  The fix is to copy the payload into a new byte array before sending it.
  
- `syslogexporter`: Fix issue where exporter may hang indefinitely while dialing. (#34393)
- `clickhouseexporter`: Use observed timestamp if timestamp is zero (#34150)
  Some OpenTelemetry libraries do not send timestamp for logs, but they should always send | the observed timestamp. In these cases the ClickHouse exporter just stored a zero timestamp | to the database. This changes the behavior to look into the observed timestamp if the timestamp | is zero.
- `webhookeventreceiver`: added a timestamp to the logs generated from incoming events. (#33702)

## v0.106.1

### 🧰 Bug fixes 🧰

- `configauth`: Fix unmarshaling of authentication in HTTP servers. (#34325)
  This brings in a bug fix from the core collector. See https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/issues/10750.

## v0.106.0

### 🛑 Breaking changes 🛑

- `vcenterreceiver`: Enables various vCenter metrics that were disabled by default until v0.106.0 (#33607)
  The following metrics will be enabled by default "vcenter.datacenter.cluster.count", "vcenter.datacenter.vm.count", "vcenter.datacenter.datastore.count",
  "vcenter.datacenter.host.count", "vcenter.datacenter.disk.space", "vcenter.datacenter.cpu.limit", "vcenter.datacenter.memory.limit",
  "vcenter.resource_pool.memory.swapped", "vcenter.resource_pool.memory.ballooned", and "vcenter.resource_pool.memory.granted". The 
  "resourcePoolMemoryUsageAttribute" has also been bumped up to release v.0.107.0
  
- `googlemanagedprometheusexporter`: Fix typo in `exporter.googlemanagedpromethues.intToDouble` feature gate (#34232)

### 🚩 Deprecations 🚩

- `k8sattributesprocessor`: Deprecate `extract.annotations.regex` and `extract.labels.regex` config fields in favor of the `ExtractPatterns` function in the transform processor. The `FieldExtractConfig.Regex` parameter will be removed in version v0.111.0. (#25128)
  Deprecating of FieldExtractConfig.Regex parameter means that it is recommended to use the `ExtractPatterns` function from the transform processor instead. To convert your current configuration please check the `ExtractPatterns` function [documentation](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/pkg/ottl/ottlfuncs#extractpatterns). You should use the `pattern` parameter of `ExtractPatterns` instead of using the `FieldExtractConfig.Regex` parameter.

### 🚀 New components 🚀

- `otlpjsonconnector`: New component that will allow extracting otlpjson data from incoming Logs. (#34239, #34208)
- `redis_storage`: Adds a new storage extension using Redis to store data in transit (#31682)

- `otlpjsonconnector`: Add connector's implementations (#34249, #34208)
- `windowsperfcountersreceiver`: Improve handling of non-existing instances for Windows Performance Counters (#33815)
  It is an expected that when querying Windows Performance Counters the targeted instances may not be present.
  The receiver will no longer require the use of `recreate_query` to handle non-existing instances.
  As soon as the instances are available, the receiver will start collecting metrics for them.
  There won't be warning log messages when there are no matches for the configured instances.
  
- `kafkareceiver`: Add settings session_timeout and heartbeat_interval to Kafka Receiver for group management facilities (#28630)
- `otelarrowreceiver, otelarrowexporter`: OTel-Arrow internal packages moved into this repository. (#33567)
  New integration testing between otelarrowexporter and otelarrowreceiver.

### 🧰 Bug fixes 🧰

- `clickhouseexporter`: Increase the default number of queue consumers to 10 (#34176)
- `opencensusreceiver`: Do not report an error into resource status during receiver shutdown when the listener connection was closed. (#33865)
- `datadogconnector`: Produce stats for non-root client and producer spans when `connector.datadogconnector.NativeIngest` and `compute_top_level_by_span_kind` are enabled (#34197)
  You should have only run into this bug when ALL the conditions below are met | 1. feature gate `connector.datadogconnector.NativeIngest` is enabled | 2. config `compute_top_level_by_span_kind` is set to true | 3. config `compute_stats_by_span_kind` is unset or set to false | 4. you have child spans with client or producer span kind
- `datadogconnector`: Respect `_dd.measured` when `connector.datadogconnector.NativeIngest` is enabled (#34197)
  Spans with attribute `_dd.measured` set to 1 will always get Datadog APM stats
- `deltatocumulativeprocessor`: fix bucket counts when downscaling exp histograms with odd offsets (#33831)
- `otelarrowreceiver`: Fix potential goroutine leak when in stream-shutdown. (#34236)
- `otelarrowreceiver`: Eliminate one spurious span error. (#34175)
- `pkg/ottl`: Handle JSON array provided to ParseJSON function (#33535)

- `statsdeceiver`: Log only non-EOF errors when reading payload received via TCP. (#33951)
- `vcenterreceiver`: Adds destroys to the ContainerViews in the client. (#34254)
  This may not be necessary, but it should be better practice than not.

## v0.105.0

### 🛑 Breaking changes 🛑

- `skywalkingexporter`: Remove unmaintained component (#23796)
- `elasticsearchexporter`: Make "dedup" option no-op, always de-duplicate. (#33773)
  Elasticsearch does not permit duplicate keys in JSON objects, so there is no value in being able to configure deduplication.
- `elasticsearchexporter`: Remove defunct "file" and "fields" configuration settings. (#33803)
  This is a breaking change only because removing the attributes would prevent collector startup if those attributes are specified, but otherwise there is no functional change. These configuration attributes have never done anything.
- `stanza`: errors from Operator.Process are returned instead of silently ignored. (#33783)
  This public function is affected: https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/pkg/stanza@v0.104.0/operator/helper#WriterOperator.Write
- `vcenterreceiver`: Enables various vCenter metrics that were disabled by default until v0.105 (#34022)
  The following metrics will be enabled by default "vcenter.host.network.packet.drop.rate",
  "vcenter.vm.cpu.readiness", "vcenter.host.cpu.capacity", and "vcenter.host.cpu.reserved".

### 💡 Enhancements 💡

- `pkg/ottl`: Added Hex() converter function (#31929)
- `pkg/ottl`: Add IsRootSpan() converter function. (#32918)
  Converter `IsRootSpan()` returns `true` if the span in the corresponding context is root, that means its `parent_span_id` equals the hexadecimal representation of zero. In all other scenarios function returns `false`.
- `vcenterreceiver`: Adds additional vCenter resource pool metrics and a memory_usage_type attribute for vcenter.resource_pool.memory.usage metric to use. (#33607)
  Added "vcenter.resource_pool.memory.swapped", "vcenter.resource_pool.memory.ballooned", and "vcenter.resource_pool.memory.granted"
  metrics. Also added an additional attribute, "memory_usage_type" for "vcenter.resource_pool.memory.usage" metric, which is
  currently under a feature gate.
  
- `kubeletstatsreceiver`: Add `k8s.pod.memory.node.utilization` and `k8s.container.memory.node.utilization` metrics (#33591)
- `vcenterreceiver`: Adds vCenter metrics at the datacenter level. (#33607)
  Introduces various datacenter metrics which work by aggregating stats from datastores, clusters, hosts, and VM's.
- `processor/resource, processor/attributes`: Add an option to extract value from a client address by specifying `client.address` value in the `from_context` field. (#34051)
- `awss3receiver`: Add support for retrieving logs and metrics to the AWS S3 Receiver. (#30750)
- `receiver/azuremonitorreceiver`: Add support for Managed Identity and Default Credential auth (#31268, #33584)
- `azuremonitorreceiver`: Add `maximum_number_of_records_per_resource` config parameter in order to overwrite default (#32165)
- `clickhouseexporter`: Upgrading stability for logs to beta (#33615)
  The logs exporter has been proven to be stable for large scale production deployments.
  Configuration options specific to logs are unlikely to change.
  
- `cloudfoundryreceiver`: Add support to receive CloudFoundry Logs (#32671)
- `datadogreceiver`: Add support for metrics in Datadog receiver (#18278)
- `datadogexporter`: Add a feature gate `exporter.datadogexporter.TraceExportUseCustomHTTPClient` that allows a custom HTTP client to be used in trace export (#34025)
  This is an experimental feature. By default the feature gate is disabled and trace export uses a default HTTP client.
- `elasticsearchexporter`: Introduce experimental `telemetry.log_request_body` and `telemetry.log_response_body` config (#33854)
- `cmd/opampsupervisor`: Adds support for forwarding custom messages to/from the agent (#33575)

- `awsxrayexporter`: Allow multiple log group names/arns to be set in environmental variables (#33795)
- `dockerobserver`: Add hint to error when using float for `api_version` field (#34043)
- `dockerstatsreceiver`: Add hint to error when using float for `api_version` field (#34043)
- `pkg/ottl`: Emit traces for statement sequence executions to troubleshoot OTTL statements/conditions (#33433)
- `pkg/stanza`: Bump 'logs.jsonParserArray' and 'logs.assignKeys' feature gates to beta. (#33948)
  This enables the feature gates by default to allow use of the
  `json_array_parser` and `assign_keys` operations.
  
- `receiver/filelog`: Add filelog.container.removeOriginalTimeField feature-flag for removing original time field (#33946)
- `statsdreceiver`: Allow configuring summary percentiles (#33701)
- `pkg/stanza`: Switch to faster json parser lib for container operator (#33929)
- `telemetrygen`: telemetrygen `--rate` flag changed from Int64 to Float64 (#33984)
- `extension/opamp`: Rely on the Collector APIs to do config redaction (#34078)
  Previously all config fields had to be redacted, now `configopaque.String` is used to determine
  which fields should be redacted. As a result, fields that are not sensitive are no longer redacted.
  
- `azuremonitorreceiver`: Upgrade stability to alpha (#33689)
- `windowsperfcountersreceiver`: `windowsperfcountersreceiver` now appends an index number to additional instance names that share a name. An example of this is when scraping `\Process(*)` counters with multiple running instances of the same executable. (#32319)
  **NOTES**
  - This change can expose cardinality issues where the counters were previously collapsed under the non-indexed instance name.
  - The change mimics Windows Performance Monitor behavior: The first instance name remains unchanged, additional instances are suffixed with `#<N>` where `N=1` and is increased for each duplicate.
    - e.g. Given 3 powershell instances, this will return `powershell`, `powershell#1` and `powershell#2`.

## v0.104.0

### 🛑 Breaking changes 🛑

- `sumologicexporter`: removed compress_encoding (#33604)
- `exporter/clickhouse`: Change behavior of how default database is read from the config (#33693)
  Changed the default `database` to `default`.
  The final database will prioritize `endpoint`, unless `database` is set to a value not equal to `default`.
  If neither are specified then it defaults to the `default` database.
  Possible breaking change if someone has the DSN configured in combination with `database` config option.
  
- `exporter/clickhouse`: Add `async_insert` config option to enable inserting asynchronously by default. (#33614)
  Adds `async_insert` config option to enable inserting asynchronously by default.
  To preserve the previous behavior, set `async_insert` to `false` in your config.
  When enabled, the exporter will insert asynchronously, which can improve performance for high-throughput deployments.
  The `async_insert` option can be set to `true` or `false` to enable or disable async inserts, respectively. The default value is `true`.
  Keep in mind this setting is added since the exporter now sets it to default.
  Async insert and its related settings can still be defined in `endpoint` and `connection_params`, which take priority over the new config option.
  
- `clickhouseexporter`: Add `AggregationTemporality` column to histogram and exponential histogram tables. Rename `AggTemp` column to `AggregationTemporality` in sum table. (#33424)
  It's a breaking change. users who upgrade to the latest version need to alter the Clickhouse table:
  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE otel_metrics_exponential_histogram ADD COLUMN AggregationTemporality Int32 CODEC(ZSTD(1));
  ALTER TABLE otel_metrics_histogram ADD COLUMN AggregationTemporality Int32 CODEC(ZSTD(1));
  ALTER TABLE otel_metrics_sum RENAME COLUMN AggTemp TO AggregationTemporality;
  ```
  
- `exporter/clickhouse`: Remove deprecated `ttl_days` config option, use `ttl` instead. (#33648)
- `vcenterreceiver`: Drops support for vCenter 6.7 (#33607)
- `all`: Promote `component.UseLocalHostAsDefaultHost` feature gate to beta. This changes default endpoints from 0.0.0.0 to localhost (#30702)
  This change affects the following components:
    - extension/awsproxy
    - extension/health_check
    - extension/health_checkv2
    - extension/jaegerremotesampling
    - internal/aws/proxy

- `k8sobserver`: Add support for k8s.ingress endpoint. (#32971)
- `statsdreceiver`: Optimize statsdreceiver to reduce object allocations (#33683)
- `routingprocessor`: Use mdatagen to define the component's telemetry (#33526)
- `loadbalancerexporter`: Refactors how the load balancing exporter splits metrics (#32513)
  All splitting is *behaviorally*, the same. However, the `resource` routingID now uses the `internal/exp/metrics/identity` package to generate the load balancing key, instead of bespoke code. This means that when upgrading to this version your routes for specific metric groupings could change. However, this will be stable and all future metrics will follow the new routing
- `receiver/mongodbreceiver`: Add `server.address` and `server.port` resource attributes to MongoDB receiver. (#32810, #32350)
  The new resource attributes are added to the MongoDB receiver to distinguish metrics coming from different MongoDB instances.
    - `server.address`: The address of the MongoDB host, enabled by default.
    - `server.port`: The port of the MongoDB host, disabled by default.
  
- `observerextension`: Expose host and port in endpoint's environment (#33571)
- `rabbitmqexporter`: Promote rabbitmqexporter to alpha. (#33331)
- `pkg/ottl`: Add a `schema_url` field to access the SchemaURL in resources and scopes on all signals (#30229)
- `solacereceiver`: Renamed some SemConv fields to support latest semantic conventions for messaging spans (version `1.25.0`) (#33499)

  `sqlserver.batch.sql_recompilation.rate`
  `sqlserver.page.buffer_cache.hit_ratio`
  `sqlserver.user.connection.count`
  
- `extension/googleclientauth`: Add Google-signed ID token support (#33185)
  Update github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/opentelemetry-operations-go/extension/googleclientauth to v0.48.0.
  With this update, extension/googleclientauth now supports Google-signed ID token as auth header.
  
- `vcenterreceiver`: Adds vCenter CPU capacity and network drop rate metrics to hosts. (#33607)

### 🧰 Bug fixes 🧰

- `resourcedetectionprocessor`: Fetch CPU info only if related attributes are enabled (#33774)

  Upgrade `dataset-go` library from v0.18.0 to v0.19.0.
  Enable skipped integration test and adjust the test so it is passing again.
  Do not validate configuration, let the framework run the validation.
  
- `datasetexporter`: Upgrade dataset-go to v0.20.0 (#33812)
  Upgrade `dataset-go` library from v0.19.0 to v0.20.0.
  Make number of outgoing connections configurable.
  
- `datadogexporter`: Fix panics on invalid sized trace & span IDs (#33566)
  See https://github.com/DataDog/opentelemetry-mapping-go/pull/340 for details.
- `datadogexporter`: Ignore metric datapoints with `no recorded value` flag (#33728)
  This flag is not supported by Datadog, so we just ignore these datapoints. See https://github.com/DataDog/opentelemetry-mapping-go/pull/330 for details.
- `tailsamplingprocessor`: Fix precedence of inverted match in and policy (#33671)
  Previously if the decision from a policy evaluation was `NotSampled` or `InvertNotSampled` it would return a `NotSampled` decision regardless, effectively downgrading the result.
  
  This was breaking the documented behaviour that inverted decisions should take precedence over all others.
  
- `otelarrowreceiver`: Ensure consume operations are not canceled at stream EOF. (#33570)
- `vcenterreceiver`: Fixes errors in some of the client calls for environments containing multiple datacenters. (#33734)

## v0.103.0

### 🛑 Breaking changes 🛑

- `cmd/opampsupervisor,extension/opamp`: Upgrade the opamp-go library to v0.15.0 (#33416)
  With this change, UUIDv7 is recommended for the OpAMP extension's instance_uid field instead of ULID. ULIDs will continue to work, but may be displayed as UUIDs.
  The supervisor's persistent state (${storage_dir}/persistent_state.yaml) will need to be cleared to generate a new UUIDv7 instead of a ULID.
  This change may be incompatible with management servers using v0.14.0 of opamp-go.
  
- `mongodbreceiver`: Now only supports `TCP` connections (#32199)
  This fixes a bug where hosts had to explicitly set `tcp` as the transport type. The `transport` option has been removed.
- `cmd/configschema`: Removes the deprecated `configschema` command. This command will no longer be released or supported. (#33384)
- `sqlserverreceiver`: sqlserver.database.io.read_latency has been renamed to sqlserver.database.latency with a `direction` attribute. (#29865)

### 🚩 Deprecations 🚩

- `healthcheckextension`: Remove incorrect logic behind `check_collector_pipeline` config (#33469)
  This logic incorrectly set the pipeline to OK after waiting for enough callbacks from the
  opencensus library to be called. As this was broken, I'm removing it to remove the dependency
  on opencensus as well. Improvements will be available via healthcheckv2 extension.
  
- `googlecloudspannerreceiver`: Mark the component as unmaintained. If we don't find new maintainers, it will be deprecated and removed. (#32651)

### 💡 Enhancements 💡

- `filelogreceiver`: If include_file_record_number is true, it will add the file record number as the attribute `log.file.record_number` (#33530)

- `elasticsearchexporter`: Add support for confighttp options, notably "auth". (#33367)
  Add support for confighttp and related configuration settings, such as "auth".
  This change also means that the Elasticsearch URL may be specified as "endpoint",
  like the otlphttp exporter.
  
- `elasticsearchexporter`: Check that endpoints are valid URLs during config validation. (#33350)
  Check that endpoints are valid URLs during config validation so that
  an invalid endpoint causes a fatal error during startup, rather than
  leading to a persistent runtime error.
  
- `opampsupervisor`: Add config validation for the supervisor config (#32843)
- `statsdreceiver`: Added received/accepted/refused metrics (#24278)
- `filelogreceiver`: Add support for gzip compressed log files (#2328)
- `confmap/provider/secretsmanagerprovider`: Add support for JSON formatted secrets in secretsmanagerprovider confmap (#32143)
  The `secretsmanagerprovider` confmap will now allow to get secret by a json key if the secret value is json.
  To specify key separate key from secret name/arn by `#` e.g. `mySecret#mySecretKey`.
  
- `geoipprocessor`: Add initial processing based on source.address resource attribute (#32663)
- `healthcheckv2extension`: Add shared aggregation logic for status events. (#26661)
- `tailsamplingprocessor`: Simple LRU Decision Cache for "keep" decisions (#31583)
- `processor/tailsampling`: Migrates internal telemetry to OpenTelemetry SDK via mdatagen (#31581)
  The metric names and their properties, such as bucket boundaries for histograms, were kept like before, to keep backwards compatibility.
- `kafka`: Added `disable_fast_negotiation` configuration option for Kafka Kerberos authentication, allowing the disabling of PA-FX-FAST negotiation. (#26345)
- `pkg/ottl`: Added `keep_matching_keys` function to allow dropping all keys from a map that don't match the pattern. (#32989)
- `OTel-Arrow`: Update to OTel-Arrow v0.24.0 (#26491)
- `pkg/ottl`: Add debug logs to help troubleshoot OTTL statements/conditions (#33274)
- `pkg/ottl`: Introducing `append` function for appending items into an existing array (#32141)
- `pkg/ottl`: Introducing `URI` converter parsing URI string into SemConv (#32433)
- `probabilisticsamplerprocessor`: Add Proportional and Equalizing sampling modes (#31918)
  Both the existing hash_seed mode and the two new modes use OTEP 235 semantic conventions to encode sampling probability.
- `prometheusreceiver`: Resource attributes produced by the prometheus receiver now include stable semantic conventions for `server` and `url`. (#32814)
  To migrate from the legacy net.host.name, net.host.port, and http.scheme resource attributes, |
  migrate to server.address, server.port, and url.scheme, and then |
  set the receiver.prometheus.removeLegacyResourceAttributes feature gate.
  
- `datadogexporter`: The Datadog Exporter now supports the `proxy_url` parameter to configure an HTTP proxy to use when sending telemetry to Datadog. (#33316)
- `spanmetrics`: Produce delta temporality span metrics with StartTimeUnixNano and TimeUnixNano values representing an uninterrupted series (#31671, #30688)
  This allows producing delta span metrics instead of the more memory-intensive cumulative metrics, specifically when a downstream component can convert the delta metrics to cumulative.
- `sqlserverreceiver`: Add support for more Database IO metrics (#29865)
  The following metrics have been added:
  - sqlserver.database.latency
  - sqlserver.database.io
  - sqlserver.database.operations
  
- `cmd/opampsupervisor`: Receive and report effective config to the OpAMP server (#30622)
- `processor/transform`: Add `transform.flatten.logs` featuregate to give each log record a distinct resource and scope. (#32080)
  This option is useful when applying transformations which alter the resource or scope. e.g. `set(resource.attributes["to"], attributes["from"])`, which may otherwise result in unexpected behavior. Using this option typically incurs a performance penalty as the processor must compute many hashes and create copies of resource and scope information for every log record.
  
- `receiver/windowsperfcounters`: Counter configuration now supports recreating the underlying performance query at scrape time. (#32798)

### 🧰 Bug fixes 🧰

- `filelogreceiver`: Container parser should add k8s metadata as resource attributes and not as log record attributes (#33341)
- `deltatocumulative`: properly drop samples when at limit (#33285)
  fixes a segfault in the limiting behavior, where streams exceeding the limit still had their samples processed. due to not being tracked, this led to a nil-pointer deref
- `postgresqlreceiver`: Fix bug where `postgresql.rows` always returning 0 for `state="dead"` (#33489)
- `prometheusreceiver`: Fall back to scrape config job/instance labels for aggregated metrics without instance/job labels (#32555)

## v0.102.0

### 🛑 Breaking changes 🛑

- `k8sattributesprocessor`: Move `k8sattr.rfc3339` feature gate to stable. (#33304)
- `extension/opamp`: Redact all values in the effective config (#33267)
  All values will be treated as if they are a `configopaque.String` type. This will
  be changed once the Collector APIs are updated to unmarshal the config while
  only redacting actual `configopaque.String`-typed values.
  
  The exception to redaction is the `service::pipelines` section, which is useful
  for debugging and does not contain any `configopaque.String` values.
  
- `extension/filestorage`: Replace path-unsafe characters in component names (#3148)
  The feature gate `extension.filestorage.replaceUnsafeCharacters` is now removed.
- `vcenterreceiver`: vcenterreceiver replaces deprecated packet metrics by removing them and enabling by default the newer ones. (#32929, #32835)
  Removes the following metrics: `vcenter.host.network.packet.errors`, `vcenter.host.network.packet.count`, and
  `vcenter.vm.network.packet.count`. 
  
  Also enables by default the following metrics: `vcenter.host.network.packet.error.rate`,
  `vcenter.host.network.packet.rate`, and `vcenter.vm.network.packet.rate`.

- `remotetapprocessor`: Make the `limit` configuration work properly. (#32385)
  The `limit` configuration was ignored previously, but now it works according to the configuration and documentation.
  Nothing is required of users.
  See the remotetapprocessor's `README.md` for details.
  
- `groupbytraceprocessor`: Fix groupbytrace metrics contain duplicate prefix (#32698)
- `vcenterreceiver`: Removes `vcenter.cluster.name` attribute from `vcenter.datastore` metrics (#32674)
  If there were multiple Clusters, Datastore metrics were being repeated under Resources differentiated with a
  `vcenter.cluster.name` resource attribute. In the same vein, if there were standalone Hosts, in addition to
  clusters the metrics would be repeated under a Resource without the `vcenter.cluster.name` attribute. Now there
  will only be a single set of metrics for one Datastore (as there should be, as Datastores don't belong to
  Clusters).
  
- `resourcedetectionprocessor`: Move `processor.resourcedetection.hostCPUModelAndFamilyAsString` feature gate to stable. (#29025)
- `filelog, journald, tcp, udp, syslog, windowseventlog receivers`: The internal logger has been changed from zap.SugaredLogger to zap.Logger. (#32177)
  This should not have any meaningful impact on most users but the logging format for some logs may have changed.

- `elasticsearchexporter`: Replace go-elasticsearch BulkIndexer with go-docappender (#32378)
  Replace go-elasticsearch BulkIndexer with go-docappender bulk indexer, in preparation for future reliability fixes.
  As a result of this change, there are minor behavioral differences:
  - flush timeout is now enforced on client side
  - oversize payload special handling is now removed
  - go-docappender uses bulk request filterPath which means bulk response is smaller, less JSON parsing and lower CPU usage
  - document level retry debug logging is removed as retries are done transparently
  
- `elasticsearchexporter`: Converts more SemConv fields in OTel events to ECS fields in Elasticsearch documents when `mapping.mode: ecs` is specified. (#31694)
- `extension/storage/filestorage`: New flag cleanup_on_start for the compaction section (default=false). (#32863)
  It will remove all temporary files in the compaction directory (those which start with `tempdb`),
  temp files will be left if a previous run of the process is killed while compacting.

  The resource attributes that will now be enabled by default are `vcenter.datacenter.name`, `vcenter.virtual_app.name`,
  `vcenter.virtual_app.inventory_path`, `vcenter.vm_template.name`, and `vcenter.vm_template.id`. The metric
  `vcenter.cluster.memory.used` will be removed.  The metrics `vcenter.cluster.vm_template.count` and
  `vcenter.vm.memory.utilization` will be enabled by default.

### 🧰 Bug fixes 🧰

- `deltatocumulativeprocessor`: Evict only stale streams (#33014)
  Changes eviction behavior to only evict streams that are actually stale.
  Currently, once the stream limit is hit, on each new stream the oldest tracked one is evicted.
  Under heavy load this can rapidly delete all streams over and over, rendering the processor useless.
  
- `elasticsearchexporter`: Retried docs are no longer included in failed docs in an edge case where all errors are retriable (#33092)
  Update dep go-docappender to 2.1.2.
  This fixes the bug when all errors are retriable in bulk request response, retried docs will be included in failed docs.

## v0.100.0

### 🛑 Breaking changes 🛑

- `receiver/hostmetrics`: enable feature gate `receiver.hostmetrics.normalizeProcessCPUUtilization` (#31368)
  This changes the value of the metric `process.cpu.utilization` by dividing it by the number of CPU cores.
  For example, if a process is using 2 CPU cores on a 16-core machine,
  the value of this metric was previously `2`, but now it will be `0.125`.
  
- `testbed`: Remove deprecated `GetAvailablePort` function (#32800)

### 🚀 New components 🚀

  Previously, the status codes that trigger retries were hardcoded to be 429, 500, 502, 503, 504.
  It is now configurable using `retry.retry_on_status`, and defaults to `[429, 500, 502, 503, 504]` to avoid a breaking change.
  To avoid duplicates, it is recommended to configure `retry.retry_on_status` to `[429]`, which would be the default in a future version.

- `ptracetest`: Add support for ignore scope span instrumentation scope information (#32852)
- `sqlserverreceiver`: Enable direct connection to SQL Server (#30297)
  Directly connecting to SQL Server will enable the receiver to gather more metrics
  for observing the SQL Server instance. The first metric added with this update is
  `sqlserver.database.io.read_latency`.
  
- `connector/datadog`: The Datadog connector now has a config option to identify top-level spans by span kind. This new logic can be enabled by setting `traces::compute_top_level_by_span_kind` to true in the Datadog connector config. Default is false. (#32005)
  `traces::compute_top_level_by_span_kind` needs to be enabled in both the Datadog connector and Datadog exporter configs if both components are being used.
  With this new logic, root spans and spans with a server or consumer `span.kind` will be marked as top-level. Additionally, spans with a client or producer `span.kind` will have stats computed.
  Enabling this config option may increase the number of spans that generate trace metrics, and may change which spans appear as top-level in Datadog.

### 🛑 Breaking changes 🛑

- `podmanreceiver`: Adds metrics and resources metadata and sets seconds precision for cpu metrics (#28640)
- `clickhouseexporter`: Add ServiceName as `column` into Clickhouse metrics tables (#31670)
  It's a breaking change. users who upgrade to the latest version need to alter the Clickhouse table:

- `pkg/stanza`: Revert recombine operator's 'overwrite_with' default value. (#30783)
  Restores the previous the default value of `oldest`, meaning that the recombine operator will emit the
  first entry from each batch (with the recombined field). This fixes the bug introduced by 30783 and restores
  the default setting so as to effectively cancel out the bug for users who were not using this setting.
  For users who were explicitly setting `overwrite_with`, this corrects the intended behavior.
  
- `processor/attributes, processor/resource`: Remove stable coreinternal.attraction.hash.sha256 feature gate. (#31997)
- `receiver/dockerstats`: Remove stable receiver.dockerstats.useScraperV2 feature gate. (#31999)

  In the past, X-Ray doesn’t support “.”. So we have a translator in x-ray export to translates it to “_” before sending traces to X-Ray Service. | To match otel naming style, x-ray service team decide to change their service to support both "." type and "" type of naming. In this case the translator that translate "." to "" is no-longer needed. This PR change the way this translator work | X-Ray PMs agree on rolling out this change by using feature-gate

- `exceptionsconnector`: change stability of exceptionsconnector from development to alpha (#31820)
- `exceptionsconnector`: Copy span attributes to the generated log from exception. (#24410)
- `prometheusreceiver`: Allows receiving prometheus native histograms (#26555)
  - Native histograms are compatible with OTEL exponential histograms.
  - The feature can be enabled via the feature gate `receiver.prometheusreceiver.EnableNativeHistograms`.
    Run the collector with the command line option `--feature-gates=receiver.prometheusreceiver.EnableNativeHistograms`.
  - Currently the feature also requires that targets are scraped via the ProtoBuf format.
    To start scraping native histograms, set
    `config.global.scrape_protocols` to `[ PrometheusProto, OpenMetricsText1.0.0, OpenMetricsText0.0.1, PrometheusText0.0.4 ]` in the
    receiver configuration. This requirement will be lifted once Prometheus can scrape native histograms over text formats.

### 🧰 Bug fixes 🧰

- `pkg/stanza`: Add 'allow_skip_pri_header' flag to syslog setting. (#30397)
  Allow parsing syslog records without PRI header. Currently pri header is beng enforced although it's not mandatory by the RFC standard. Since influxdata/go-syslog is not maintained we had to switch to haimrubinstein/go-syslog.

## v0.94.0

### 🛑 Breaking changes 🛑

- `servicegraphprocessor`: removed deprecated component, use the servicegraph connector instead. (#26091)
- `datadogconnector`: Enable feature gate `connector.datadogconnector.performance` by default. (#30829)
  See https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/connector/datadogconnector#feature-gate-for-performance for caveats of this feature gate.
- `datadogprocessor`: Delete datadogprocessor which has been deprecated since v0.84.0 (#31026)
  Use datadogconnector instead.
- `kafkareceiver`: standardizes the default topic name for metrics and logs receivers to the same topic name as the metrics and logs exporters of the kafkaexporter (#27292)
  If you are using the Kafka receiver in a logs and/or a metrics pipeline
  and you are not customizing the name of the topic to read from with the `topic` property,
  the receiver will now read from `otlp_logs` or `otlp_metrics` topic instead of `otlp_spans` topic.
  To maintain previous behavior, set the `topic` property to `otlp_spans`.
  
- `pkg/stanza`: Entries are no longer logged during error conditions. (#26670)
  This change is being made to ensure sensitive information contained in logs are never logged inadvertently.
  This change is a breaking change because it may change user expectations. However, it should require
  no action on the part of the user unless they are relying on logs from a few specific error cases.
  
- `pkg/stanza`: Invert recombine operator's 'overwrite_with' default value. (#30783)
  Previously, the default value was `oldest`, meaning that the recombine operator _should_ emit the
  first entry from each batch (with the recombined field). However, the actual behavior was inverted.
  This fixes the bug but also inverts the default setting so as to effectively cancel out the bug fix
  for users who were not using this setting. For users who were explicitly setting `overwrite_with`,
  this corrects the intended behavior.
  

### 🚩 Deprecations 🚩

- `skywalkingexporter`: Mark the component as unmaintained. If we don't find new maintainers, it will be deprecated and removed. (#23796)

  compute_stats_by_span_kind: enables an additional stats computation check based on span kind
  peer_tags_aggregation: enables aggregation of peer related tags
  trace_buffer: specifies the buffer size for datadog trace payloads
  
- `elasticsearchexporter`: Add `mapping.mode: raw` configuration option (#26647)
  Setting `mapping.mode: raw` in the Elasticsearch exporter's configuration
  will result logs and traces being indexed into Elasticsearch with their
  attribute fields directly at the root level of the document instead inside an
  `Attributes` object. Similarly, this setting will also result in traces being
  indexed into Elasticsearch with their event fields directly at the root level
  of the document instead of inside an `Events` object.

- `pkg/ottl`: Fix parsing of string escapes in OTTL (#23238)
- `pkg/stanza`: Recombine operator should always recombine partial logs (#30797)
  Previously, certain circumstances could result in partial logs being emitted without any
  recombination. This could occur when using `is_first_entry`, if the first partial log from
  a source was emitted before a matching "start of log" indicator was found. This could also
  occur when the collector was shutting down.
  
- `pkg/stanza`: Fix bug where recombine operator's 'overwrite_with' condition was inverted. (#30783)
- `exporter/signalfx`: Use "unknown" value for the environment correlation calls as fallback. (#31052)
  This fixed the APM/IM correlation in the Splunk Observability UI for the users that send traces with no "deployment.environment" resource attribute value set.
- `namedpipereceiver`: Fix SIGSEGV when named pipe creation fails (#31088)

  string "Z" to signify UTC time, as required by ISO 8601. Now, both
  `+0000` and `Z` are recognized as UTC times in all components that
  handle `strptime` format strings.

- `Fix problem where checkpoints could be lost when collector is shutdown abruptly`: filelogreceiver (#29609, #29491)
- `googlecloudspannerreceiver`: Google Cloud Spanner Receiver currently generates an exception and exits if it attempts to read data from a database that doesn't exist. However it's normal for a single receiver to poll multiple databases, so this is not graceful failure. This PR makes a change to gracefully generate an error in case of an unreadable missing database and then continue reading other databases.. (#26732)
- `pkg/stanza`: Allow `key_value_parser` to parse values that contain the delimiter string. (#29629)

## v0.90.1

- `signalfxexporter`: change default timeout to 10 seconds (#29436)
- `awss3exporter`: add support for `s3_force_path_style` and `disable_ssl` parameters (#29331)
  In order to support alternative object-storage, these parameters are useful and help to leverage those systems not
  compatible with domain style path, or just hosted without ssl (like just deployed in a k8s namespace).
  
- `hostmetricsreceiver`: Add optional Linux-only metric `system.linux.memory.available` (#7417)
  This is an alternative to `system.memory.usage` metric with `state=free`.
  Linux starting from 3.14 exports "available" memory. It takes "free" memory as a baseline, and then factors in kernel-specific values.
  This is supposed to be more accurate than just "free" memory.
  For reference, see the calculations referenced in [What is the difference between MemFree and MemAvailable in /proc/meminfo](https://superuser.com/a/980821).
  See also `MemAvailable` in [/proc/meminfo](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/proc.5.html).

- `mongodbreceiver`: add `receiver.mongodb.removeDatabaseAttr` Alpha feature gate to remove duplicate database name attribute (#24972)
- `pkg/stanza`: Fix panic during stop for udp async mode only. (#29120)

## v0.89.0

### 🛑 Breaking changes 🛑

- `pkg/stanza`: Improve parsing of Windows Event XML by handling anonymous `Data` elements. (#21491)
  This improves the contents of Windows log events for which the publisher manifest is unavailable. Previously, anonymous `Data` elements were ignored. This is a breaking change for users who were relying on the previous data format.
- `processor/k8sattributes`: Graduate "k8sattr.rfc3339" feature gate to Beta. (#28817)
  Time format of `k8s.pod.start_time` attribute value migrated from RFC3339:
  Before: 2023-07-10 12:34:39.740638 -0700 PDT m=+0.020184946
  After: 2023-07-10T12:39:53.112485-07:00
  The feature gate can be temporary reverted back by adding `--feature-gate=-k8sattr.rfc3339` to the command line.
  
- `filelogreceiver`: Change "Started watching file" log behavior (#28491)
  Previously, every unique file path which was found by the receiver would be remembered indefinitely.
  This list was kept independently of the uniqueness / checkpointing mechanism (which does not rely on the file path).
  The purpose of this list was to allow us to emit a lot whenever a path was seen for the first time.
  This removes the separate list and relies instead on the same mechanism as checkpointing. Now, a similar log is emitted
  any time a file is found which is not currently checkpointed. Because the checkpointing mechanism does not maintain history
  indefinitely, it is now possible that a log will be emitted for the same file path. This will happen when no file exists at
  the path for a period of time.
  
- `dockerstatsreceiver`: cpu.container.percent metric is removed in favor of container.cpu.utilization (#21807)
  The metric `container.cpu.percentage` is now removed. `container.cpu.utilization` is enabled by default as a replacement.
  For details, see the [docs](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/dockerstatsreceiver#transition-to-cpu-utilization-metric-name-aligned-with-opentelemetry-specification).

### 💡 Enhancements 💡

- `awsxrayexporter`: Convert individual HTTP error events into exceptions within subsegments for AWS SDK spans and strip AWS.SDK prefix from remote aws service name (#27232)
- `azuremonitorexporter`: Added connection string support to the Azure Monitor Exporter (#28853)
  This enhancement simplifies the configuration process and aligns the exporter with Azure Monitor's recommended practices.
  The Connection String method allows the inclusion of various fields such as the InstrumentationKey and IngestionEndpoint
  within a single string, facilitating an easier and more integrated setup.
  While the traditional InstrumentationKey method remains supported for backward compatibility, it will be phased out.
  Users are encouraged to adopt the Connection String approach to ensure future compatibility and to leverage the broader
  configuration options it enables.
  
- `opensearchexporter`: Add log exporting capability to the opensearchexporter. (#23611)
- `pdatatest`: Allow to compare metrics resource attributes or metric attribute values by matching on a portion of the dimension value with a regular expression. (#27690)

- `spanmetricsconnector`: Add exemplars to sum metric (#27451)
- `exporter/syslog`: send syslog messages in batches (#21244)
  This changes the behavior of the Syslog exporter to send each batch of Syslog messages in a single request (with messages separated by newlines), instead of sending each message in a separate request and closing the connection after each message.
- `cmd/telemetrygen`: Use exporter per worker for better metrics throughput (#26709)
- `cmd/telemetrygen`: Add support for --otlp-http for telemetrygen logs (#18867)
- `exporter/awss3exporter`: This feature allows role assumption for s3 exportation. It is especially useful on Kubernetes clusters that are using IAM roles for service accounts (#28674)

- `servicegraphprocessor, servicegraphconnector`: Measure latency in seconds instead of milliseconds (#27488)
  Measures latency in seconds instead of milliseconds, as the metric name indicates.
  Previously, milliseconds was used.
  This unit is still available via the feature gate `processor.servicegraph.legacyLatencyUnitMs`.
  This is a breaking change.

- `pkg/ottl`: Add converters to convert time to unix nanoseconds, unix microseconds, unix milliseconds or unix seconds (#24686)
- `oauth2clientauthextension`: Enable dynamically reading ClientID and ClientSecret from files (#26117)
  - Read the client ID and/or secret from a file by specifying the file path to the ClientIDFile (`client_id_file`) and ClientSecretFile (`client_secret_file`) fields respectively.
  - The file is read every time the client issues a new token. This means that the corresponding value can change dynamically during the execution by modifying the file contents.
  
- `receiver/hostmetrics`: Don't collect connections data from the host if system.network.connections metric is disabled to not waste CPU cycles. (#25815)
- `jaegerreceiver,jaegerremotesamplingextension`: Add featuregates to replace Thrift-gen with Proto-gen types for sampling strategies (#18401)

- `datadogexporter`: Host metadata for remote hosts is now reported on first sight or on change (#25145)
  Host metadata for remote hosts will only be sent for payloads with the datadog.host.use_as_metadata resource attribute.
  

### 🧰 Bug fixes 🧰

- `processor/routing`: When using attributes instead of resource attributes, the routing processor would crash the collector. This does not affect the connector version of this component. (#26462)
- `awsemfexporter`: Fix possible panic in when configuration option `awsemf.output_destination:stdout` is set (#26250)
- `snmpreceiver`: Fix how to determine how many RAs on a metric are scalar (#26363)

- `snmpreceiver`: SNMP values of type Counter64 were seen as unsupported, because the returned data type uint64 was unhandeled. (#23897, #26119)
- `pkg/stanza`: Fix issue unsupported type 'syslog_parser' (#26452)

## v0.84.0

### 🛑 Breaking changes 🛑

- `jaegerreceiver`: Deprecate remote_sampling config in the jaeger receiver (#24186)
  The jaeger receiver will fail to start if remote_sampling config is specified in it.  The `receiver.jaeger.DisableRemoteSampling` feature gate can be set to let the receiver start and treat  remote_sampling config as no-op. In a future version this feature gate will be removed and the receiver will always  fail when remote_sampling config is specified.
  
- `googlecloudexporter`: remove retry_on_failure from the googlecloud exporter. The exporter itself handles retries, and retrying can cause issues. (#57233)
- `vcenterreceiver`: Dimensions performance metrics into metric attribute `object` (#25147)
  The following metrics have been effected to include the new metric attribute to properly dimension the data.`vcenter.vm.network.throughput`,`vcenter.vm.network.usage`,`vcenter.vm.network.packet.count`,`vcenter.vm.disk.latency.avg`,`vcenter.vm.disk.latency.max`,`vcenter.host.network.usage`,`vcenter.host.network.throughput`,`vcenter.host.network.packet.count`,`vcenter.host.network.packet.errors`,

### 🛑 Breaking changes 🛑

- `receiver/k8scluster`: Unify predefined and custom node metrics. (#24776)
  - Update metrics description and units to be consistent
  - Remove predefined metrics definitions from metadata.yaml because they are controlled by `node_conditions_to_report` 
    and `allocatable_types_to_report` config options.
  
- `prometheusexporter`: Remove invalid unit translations from the prometheus exporters (#24647)
- `receiver/prometheusexec`: Removes the deprecated prometheus_exec receiver (#24740)

  This component replaces the Datadog processor
  
- `gitproviderreceiver`: Add the skeleton for the new gitproviderreceiver in development with accompanying github scraper. (#22028)

### 💡 Enhancements 💡

- `azuredataexplorerexporter`: Add support for managed identity. This enables users to not use Key based authentication (#21924)
- `awsemfexporter`: Add awsemf.nodimrollupdefault feature gate to aws emf exporter (#23997)
  Enabling the awsemf.nodimrollupdefault will cause the AWS EMF Exporter to use the NoDimensionRollup configuration
  setting by default instead of ZeroAndSingleDimensionRollup.

- `transformprocessor`: Add extract_sum_metric OTTL function to transform processor (#22853)
- `prometheusreceiver`: Don't drop histograms without buckets (#22070)
- `pkg/ottl`: Add a new Function Getter to the OTTL package, to allow passing Converters as literal parameters. (#22961)
  Currently OTTL provides no way to use any defined Converter within another Editor/Converter.
  Although Converters can be passed as a parameter, they are always executed and the result is what is actually passed as the parameter.
  This allows OTTL to pass Converters themselves as a parameter so they can be executed within the function.
  
- `resourcedetectionprocessor`: GCP resource detection processor can automatically add `gcp.gce.instance.hostname` and `gcp.gce.instance.name` attributes. (#24598)
- `splunkhecexporter`: Add heartbeat check while startup and new config param, heartbeat/startup (defaults to false). This is different than the healthcheck_startup, as the latter doesn't take token or index into account. (#24411)
- `hostmetricsreceiver`: Report  logical and physical number of CPUs as metric. (#22099)
  Use the `system.cpu.logical.count::enabled` and `system.cpu.physical.count::enabled` flags to enable them

### 🧰 Bug fixes 🧰

- `receiver/sshcheck`: Add the SSH endpoint as a resource attribute (#24441)
- `awsemfexporter`: Enforce time to live on metric data that is stored for the purpose of cumulative to delta conversions within EMF Exporter (#25058)
  This change fixes a bug where the cache used to store metric information for cumulative to delta
  conversions was not enforcing its time to live. This could cause excessive memory growth in certain scenarios which could
  lead to OOM failures for Collector. To properly fix this issue package global metric caches were removed and replaced
  with caches that are unique per emf exporter. A byproduct of this change is that no two emf exporters within an 
  Collector will share a caches leading to more accurate cumulative to delta conversions. 
  
- `awsemfexporter`: Add retain_initial_value_of_delta_metric to translateOTelToGroupedMetric, allowing the initial set of metrics to be published (#24051)
- `carbonreceiver`: Fix Carbon receiver obsrecv operations memory leak (#24275)
  The carbonreceiver has a memory leak where it will repeatedly open new obsrecv operations but not close them afterwards. Those operations eventually create a burden.
  
  The fix is to make sure the receiver only creates an operation per interaction over TCP.
  
- `datadogexporter`: Populate OTLP resource attributes in Datadog logs. Changes mapping for `jvm.loaded_classes` from `process.runtime.jvm.classes.loaded` to `process.runtime.jvm.classes.current_loaded`. (#24674)
- `datadogexporter`: Fix the population of Datadog `system.*` metrics. Ensure the average is within [min, max] in histograms. (#25071)
  The minimum and maximum estimation is only used when the minimum and maximum are not available in the OTLP payload or this is a cumulative payload.
- `pkg/stanza`: Create a new decoder for each TCP/UDP connection to prevent concurrent write to buffer. (#24980)
- `exporter/kafkaexporter`: Fixes a panic when SASL configuration is not present (#24797)
- `lokitranslator, lokiexporter`: Fixes a panic that occurred during the promotion of nested attributes containing dots to labels (#25125)
- `awsxrayexporter`: Fix X-Ray Segment status code and exception translations. (#24381)
- `receiver/haproxy`: Make sure emitted resource metrics have distinct resources by default (#24921)
  This is done by enabling and renaming the following resource attributes:
    - proxy_name -> haproxy.proxy_name
    - service_name -> haproxy.service_name
  
- `receiver/k8sobjects`: Fix bug where duplicate data would be ingested for watch mode if the client connection got reset. (#24806)
- `datadogreceiver`: Fixed NPE on failed to decode message path (#24562)
- `zipkinreceiver`: Respects zipkin's serialised status tags to be converted to span status (#14965)
- `datadogexporter`: Correctly set metrics exporter capabilities to state that it mutates data (#24908)
  This could lead to random panics if using more than one metrics exporter.
  
- `processor/resourcedetection`: Do not drop all system attributes if `host.id` cannot be fetched. (#24669)
- `signalfxexporter`: convert vmpage_io* translated metrics to pages (#25064)
- `splunkhecreceiver`: aligns success resp body w/ splunk enterprise (#19219)
  changes resp from plaintext "ok" to json {"text"："success", "code"：0}

## v0.82.0

### 🛑 Breaking changes 🛑

- `receiver/awsfirehose`: Change the type of `Config.AccessKey` to be `configopaque.String` (#17273)
- `receiver/cloudfoundry`: Change the type of `Config.UAA.Password` to be `configopaque.String` (#17273)
- `exporter/datasetexporter`: Remove temporary client side attribute aggregation and corresponding traces.max_wait and traces.aggregate config options which are now redundant. (#20660)
  This pull request removes the following attributes from the DataSet trace events: services, 
  span_count, error_count. Those attributes were populated on the client side as part of the client
  side aggregation code. This client side aggregation was meant as a temporary solution until a
  proper solution is implement on the server side. Being a temporary solution meant it had many
  edge cases and would only work under specific and limited circumstances (all spans which belong
  to a trace are part of the same batch received by the plugin).
  
  Corresponding config options (traces.aggregate and traces.max_wait) which are not redundant and
  unused have also been removed.
  
- `mysqlreceiver`: removing `mysql.locked_connects` metric which is replaced by `mysql.connection.errors` (#23211)
- `pkg/ottl`: Allow access to the metrics slice in the metric context (#24446)
  This is only a breaking change for users using OTTL in custom components. For all Contrib components this is an enhancement.
- `pkg/stanza`: Make fileconsumer.PositionalScanner internal (#23999)
- `pkg/stanza`: Make fileconsumer.Fingerprint internal (#23998)
- `receiver/httpcheck`: Fail fast on endpoint missing scheme (#23020)
  Previously, when configured with an endpoint without HTTP/HTTPS scheme like "opentelemetry.io",
  the receiver would start correctly, but fail to check the endpoint, producing the `httpcheck.error`
  metric on every collection interval. After this change, the receiver fails to start, writing
  an error log saying that you need to provide a scheme in the endpoint.
  
- `receiver/jmx`: Change the types of `Config.{Password,KeystorePassword,TruststorePassword}` to be `configopaque.String` (#17273)
- `httpcheckreceiver`: support scraping multiple targets (#18823)
- `resourcedetectionprocessor`: Disable `host.id` by default on the `system` detector. This restores the behavior prior to v0.72.0 when using the `system` detector together with other detectors that set `host.id` (#21233)
  To re-enable `host.id` on the `system` detector set `system::resource_attributes::host.id::enabled` to `true`:  
  
  ```
  resourcedetection:
    detectors: [system]
    system:
      resource_attributes:
        host.id:
          enabled: true
  ```

- `receiver/podman`: Change the type of `Config.SSHPassphrase` to be `configopaque.String` (#17273)
- `receiver/postgresql`: Change the type of `Config.Password` to be `configopaque.String` (#17273)
- `prometheusreceiver`: Remove unused buffer_period and buffer_count configuration options (#24258)
- `prometheusreceiver`: Add the `trim_metric_suffixes` configuration option to allow enable metric suffix trimming. (#21743, #8950)
  When enabled, suffixes for unit and type are trimmed from metric names. 
  If you previously enabled the `pkg.translator.prometheus.NormalizeName` 
  feature gate, you will need to enable this option to have suffixes trimmed.

### 🚩 Deprecations 🚩

- `mysqlreceiver`: set `mysql.locked_connects` as optional in order to remove it in next release (#14138, #23274)

### 💡 Enhancements 💡

- `mdatagen`: Adds a parent field to metadata.yaml for subcomponents. (#23636)
- `sqlqueryreceiver`: Add support of Start and End Timestamp Column in Metric Configuration. (#18925, #14146)

- `hostmetricsreceiver`: Add new Windows-exclusive process.handles metric. (#21379)
- `websocketprocessor`: Rename websocketprocessor to remoteobserverprocessor (#23856)
- `resourcedetectionprocessor`: Adds a way to configure the list of added resource attributes by the processor (#21482)
  Users can now configure what resource attributes are gathered by specific detectors.
  Example configuration:
  
  ```
  resourcedetection:
    detectors: [system, ec2]
    system:
      resource_attributes:
        host.name:
          enabled: true
        host.id:
          enabled: false
    ec2:
      resource_attributes:
        host.name:
          enabled: false
        host.id:
          enabled: true
  ```
  
  For example, this config makes `host.name` being set by `system` detector, and `host.id` by `ec2` detector.
  Moreover:
  - Existing behavior remains unaffected as all attributes are currently enabled by default.
  - The default attributes 'enabled' values are defined in `metadata.yaml`.
  - Future releases will introduce changes to resource_attributes `enabled` values.
  - Users can tailor resource detection process to their needs and environment.
  
- `spanmetricsconnector`: Added disabling options for histogram metrics and option to exclude default labels from all metrics. In some cases users want to optionally disable part of metrics because they generate too much data or are not needed. (#16344)
- `statsdreceiver`: All receivers are setting receiver name and version when sending data. This change introduces the same behaviour to the statsd receiver. (#23563)
- `zookeeperreceiver`: Adds an additional health check metric based off of the response from the zookeeper ruok 4lw command. (#21481)
- `k8sclusterreceiver`: Switch k8s.pod and k8s.container metrics to use pdata. (#23441)

- `mongodbreceiver`: Fix missing version in mongodb creating panics during scrapes (#23859)
- `postgresqlreceiver`: fixed an issue where postgresql receiver was emitting the same attribute value "toast_hit" twice under postgresql.blocks_read metric. (#23657)

- `redisreceiver`: Updates metric unit from no unit to Bytes. (#23454)
  Affected metrics can be found below.
  - redis.clients.max_input_buffer
  - redis.clients.max_output_buffer
  - redis.replication.backlog_first_byte_offset

- `nginxreceiver`: Bump 'receiver.nginx.emitConnectionsCurrentAsSum' featuregate to beta (enabled by default) (#4326)
- `servicegraphprocessor`: Change metric names to match the spec (#18743, #16578)
  Latency metric `traces_service_graph_request_duration_seconds` are deprecated in favor of server and client metrics | `traces_service_graph_server_request_seconds` and `traces_service_graph_client_request_seconds` | respectively. Use the feature gate `processor.servicegraph.legacyLatencyMetricNames` to enable the old metric names.
- `prometheusreceiver, prometheusexporter, prometheusremotewrite`: Disable `pkg.translator.prometheus.NormalizeName` feature gate by default (#23208)
  The feature gate `pkg.translator.prometheus.NormalizeName` was enabled prematurely while translation
  on the prometheus receiver was incomplete. To address this, the feature gate has been reverted back to alpha status.
  This will remain the case until the translation on the receiver side aligns with the translation on the exporter side,
  or until it is replaced with a configuration option or completely removed. To maintain the current behavior, you can
  enable the feature gate using the `--feature-gates=pkg.translator.prometheus.NormalizeName` command argument. 
  However, please note that the translation in the prometheus receiver is a subject to future changes.

  The compression used to be enabled only if the payload size was greater than 1.5KB which significantly
  complicated the logic and made it hard to test. This change makes the compression unconditionally applied to 
  the payload if it's enabled in the config. The benchmarking shows improvements in the throughput and CPU usage for 
  large payloads and expected degradation for small payloads which is acceptable given that it's not a common case.

## v0.73.0

### 🛑 Breaking changes 🛑

- `googlecloudexporter`: Disable retry helper by default in GCP and GMP exporter configs. (#19203)
- `k8sattributesprocessor`: Remove `container.id` as default metadata given possible ambiguity matching a container run to a container ID (#16432)
- `pkg/ottl`: Ability to reference matched capture groups in `replace_pattern()` and `replace_all_patterns()` (#18610)
  This change affects all processors that use OTTL (i.e. `transformprocessor`, `routingprocessor`, and `filterprocessor`).
  This is a breaking change in the rare scenario that the `$` character is currently used in a replacement string.
  To output a literal `$` in a replacement string it must now be escaped with an additional `$`.
- `resourcedetectionprocessor`: Bump OpenShift semconv version from 1.16.0 to 1.18.0. (#19168)
  Rename google openshift platform attribute from google_cloud_openshift to gcp_openshift.
- `spanmetricsconnector`: Drop Prometheus-specific metrics labels sanitization. (#18678)
  The spanmeterics connector is the OTel component, therefore, we would
  like to strip Prometheus-specific parts from it. Metric names and attributes
  conversion to Prometheus conventions should happen in Prometheus components,
  e.g. Prometheus Remote Write exporter.
  

### 🚀 New components 🚀

- `hostmetrics`: Have the hostmetrics receiver file system scraper use more debug messages (#18236)
  Log a debug message instead of an error if the collector does not have the permissions to access a locked drive on the host. We do not want to log an error message on every poll for this case.
- `exporter/prometheus`: Produce exemplars for monotonic sum metrics (i.e. counters in Prometheus) when available (#18201)
  This could be a breaking change if you already have enabled OpenMetrics format for the Prometheus exporter and have enabled exemplar ingestion in your Prometheus scraper.  To ensure names and types are generated correctly according to the OpenMetrics conventions, you should run your collector with `--feature-gates=pkg.translator.prometheus.NormalizeName`
- `filelogreceiver`: Adds ability to parse a file header and parse it as metadata to decorate log entries. (#18198)
  This feature must be activated with the `filelog.allowHeaderMetadataParsing` feature gate.

- `k8sattributesprocessor`: Default `container.id` to latest instance unless `k8s.container.restart_count` is specified (#16432)
- `mdatagen`: Turn on the ability to enable/disable resource attributes by embedding MetricsSettings and ResourceAttributesSettings into all scraping receivers as MetricsBuilderConfig (#16373)
  Currently, the only way to add configurative functionality to mdatagen is by using a bunch of WithResourceAttributesSettings options to the constructor.
  This PR changes the first argument to the NewMetricsBuilder constructor to be of type MetricsBuilderConfig,
  which is a new class that wraps both MetricsSettings and ResourceAttributesSettings, and may be (hopefully) easily extended with more
  configuration in the future.

- `receiver/purefareceiver`: Updating documentation to include required configuration fields. (#14886)
- `clickhousexporter`: Clickhouse string type cast function of insert flow changed because of missing span values. (#17834)
- `prometheusremotewriteexporter`: Export `_created` metric for Summary, Histogram and Monotonic Sum metric points if `StartTimeUnixNano` is set. (#17412, #12426)
  The export of tbe `_created` metric is configurable in the Prometheus remote write exporter. It is disabled by default.
- `clickhouseexporter`: Fix "no such host" error when the DSN hostname contains the database name (#16476)
- `oracledbreceiver`: the resource attribute `oracledb.instance.name` now captures the database name. (#17850)
- `signalfxexporter`: Make sure the metadata updater is tied to the exporter itself, so it can tack on the exporter lifecycle. (#17976)
- `mdatagen`: Fixing templateFS to work on windows systems (#17576)
  This fix will allow the command to work as a static binary without needing reference to the templates on disk.
  
- `pkg/ottl`: Fix issue where IsMatch returned an error if the target val was nil (#17572)
  - Affected components
    - `filterprocessor`
    - `routingprocessor`
    - `transformprocessor`
  
- `batchperresourceattr`: Optimize batch processor attribute and don't reset the caller's instance, instead make a copy of the original resource attributes (#17835)
- `receiver/prometheusreceiver`: Use `_created` metrics, if present, to set `StartTimeUnixNano` for Sum, Histogram and Summary metrics. (#12428)
  If the `_created` metric was present in the Histogram, Summary or Counter
  metric family, only then its values is used to set `StartTimeUnixNano` on the
  relevant OTLP metric and dropped afterwards. Otherwise, it is converted to the
  monotonic OTLP Sum metric.
  This behaviour is disabled by default. Use the `receiver.prometheusreceiver.UseCreatedMetric`
  to enable it.
  
- `exporter/prometheusremotewriteexporter`: Export exemplars for the Monotonic Sum metric. (#17573)
- `windowseventlogreceiver`: Fix panic that can occur when event is larger than current buffer size. (#17879)
- `windowseventlogreceiver`: Fixed a panic that could create an empty buffer due to incorrect use of unsafe pointers in syscall. (#17878)
  Fixed a potential panic due to a syscall indicating a that the event buffer should resize to 0. The next used of that resized buffer would result in an index out of bounds panic.
  
  Also, added a safety check for buffer resize cases that if the syscall indicates it needs the buffer size to be 0, an error will be returned.

## v0.64.0

### 🛑 Breaking changes 🛑

- `pkg/stanza, filelog, journald, syslog, tcplog, udplog, windowseventlog, logstransform`: Remove ability to configure `converter`. (#15696)
  The design of the converter is opaque and its behavior may change in the future.
  Because of this, the `converter` settings are deemed unstable. The actual behavior of the
  converter remains unchanged, but will always use the former default values.

- `exporter/googlemanagedprometheusexporter`: Moved ClientConfig under MetricConfig, and added an option to change the default metric name prefix for advanced use cases. (#10543)
- `pkg/ottl`: Update `ExprFunc`, `Set`, and `Get` to all return errors. (#15649)
- `pkg/ottl`: Change Statement to use `Expr[K]` and `BoolExpr[K]` and for `Statement.Execute` to require `context.Context`. (#15709)
- `tanzuobservabilityexporter`: Add a new metric exporter config(app_tags_excluded) to exclude application resource attrs(application, service.name, cluster, shard) from the metric tags. Rename the config resource_attributes to resource_attrs_included. Build in-house logic in the tanzuobservability exporter and remove the usage of resourcetotelemetry. (#14733)

### 🚩 Deprecations 🚩

- `hostmetricsreceiver`: Introduce renamed process memory metrics (#14327)
  This starts the process of phasing out incorrect metric names:

  - `process.memory.physical_usage`
  - `process.memory.virtual_usage`

  and replacing them with the names adhering to the semantic conventions:

  - `process.memory.usage`
  - `process.memory.virtual`

  At this stage, the new metrics are added, but they are disabled by default.
  See the "Deprecations" section of the Host Metrics receiver's README for details.


### 💡 Enhancements 💡

# v0.59.0

## 🛑 Breaking changes 🛑
- `elasticsearchreceiver`: Remove direction for metrics. The feature gate: receiver.elasticsearchreceiver.emitMetricsWithoutDirectionAttribute can be set to apply the following (#13258) (#12189)
  - `elasticsearch` metrics:
    - `elasticsearch.node.cluster.io` will become:
      - `elasticsearch.node.cluster.io.received`
      - `elasticsearch.node.cluster.io.sent`
- `kubeletstatsreceiver`: Remove direction for metrics. The feature gate: receiver.kubeletstatsreceiver.emitMetricsWithoutDirectionAttribute can be set to apply the following (#12588) (#12164)
  - `kubeletstats` metrics:
    - `k8s.node.network.io` will become:
      - `k8s.node.network.io.transmit`
      - `k8s.node.network.io.receive`
    - `k8s.node.network.errors` will become:
      - `k8s.node.network.errors.transmit`
      - `k8s.node.network.errors.receive`
- `processor/metricstransform`: Remove `processor.metricstransformprocessor.UseOTLPDataModel` feature flag. OpenCensus-based implementation is not available anymore.
 (#13405)
- `exporter/mezmoexporter`: This change removes the hardcoded "otel" hostname that was embedded
in outgoing logs data.
 (#13410)
  It is replaced by:

    1. Sending to a new collector endpoint that does not require the
    hostname parameter.

    2. Recognizing the "host.name" resource attribute and using that
    value to fill in log metadata recognized upstream.

    This is a breaking change, and as such will generate a startup
    error if the exporter is configured to send to an endpoint that
    does not support this feature.
