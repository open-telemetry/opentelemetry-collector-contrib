# Changelog

<!-- next version -->

## v0.79.0

### 🛑 Breaking changes 🛑

- `attributesprocessor`: Enable SHA-256 as hashing algorithm by default for attributesprocessor hashing action (#4759)
- `windowseventlogreceiver`: Emit raw Windows events as strings instead of byte arrays (#22704)
- `receiver/httpcheck`: Removed the default `endpoint` value of `http://localhost:80`. The `endpoint` property is now required. (#22995)
- `pkg/ottl`: Removes `StandardTypeGetter` in favor of `StandardStringGetter`, `StandardIntGetter`, `StandardFloatGetter`, and `StandardPMapGetter`, which handle converting pcommon.Values of the proper type. (#22763)
  This is only a breaking change for users using OTTL in custom components. For all Contrib components this is an enhancement.
- `postgresqlreceiver`: Remove resource attribute feature gates (#22479)

### 🚩 Deprecations 🚩

- `dockerstatsreceiver`: cpu.container.percent metric will be deprecated in v0.79.0 in favor of container.cpu.utilization (#21807)
  This starts the process of phasing out incorrect metric name:
  - `container.cpu.utilization`
  and replacing it with the names adhering to the semantic conventions:
  - `container.cpu.percent`
  At this stage, the new metric is added, but is disabled by default.
  See the "Deprecations" section of the Docker Stats receiver's README for details.

  - `vcenter`
  - `windowsperfcounters`
  - `zookeeper`
- `oracledbreceiver`: Add a simpler alternative configuration option (#22087)
- `exporter/datadog`: Upgrade opentelemetry-mapping-go to v0.3.0 and use pkg/otlp/logs for logs translation (#23137)

- `solacereceiver`: Updated solacereceiver to handle new features of Solace PubSub+ 10.4.1 (#22809)
- `splunkhecreceiver`: Support different strategies for splitting payloads when receiving a request with the Splunk HEC receiver. (#22788)
- `exporter/splunk_hec`: Apply compression to Splunk HEC payload unconditionally if it's enabled in the config. (#22969, #22018)
  The compression used to be enabled only if the payload size was greater than 1.5KB which significantly
  complicated the logic and made it hard to test. This change makes the compression unconditionally applied to 
  the payload if it's enabled in the config. The benchmarking shows improvements in the throughput and CPU usage for 
  large payloads and expected degradation for small payloads which is acceptable given that it's not a common case.
  
- `awsxrayexporter`: Support 2 new aws service name attributes for populating X-Ray segment name (#22835)

  This change affects all processors that use OTTL (i.e. `transformprocessor`, `routingprocessor`, and `filterprocessor`).
  This is a breaking change in the rare scenario that the `$` character is currently used in a replacement string.
  To output a literal `$` in a replacement string it must now be escaped with an additional `$`.
- `resourcedetectionprocessor`: Bump OpenShift semconv version from 1.16.0 to 1.18.0. (#19168)
  Rename google openshift platform attribute from google_cloud_openshift to gcp_openshift.
- `spanmetricsconnector`: Drop Prometheus-specific metrics labels sanitization. (#18678)
  The spanmeterics connector is the OTel component, therefore, we would
  like to strip Prometheus-specific parts from it. Metric names and attributes
  conversion to Prometheus conventions should happen in Prometheus components,
  e.g. Prometheus Remote Write exporter.
  

### 🚀 New components 🚀

- `filereceiver`: Add basic file reading capabilities to file receiver. Second PR. (#14638)

  enables use of boolean attrbiutes in defining tail sampling policies
- `pkg/stanza`: Add `header_delimiter` option to the `csv_parser`. (#18198)
- `datadogexporter`: Enable gzip compression for metric payloads submitted by native Datadog client (#17373)
- `hostmetrics`: Have the hostmetrics receiver file system scraper use more debug messages (#18236)

- `exporter/prometheus`: Produce exemplars for monotonic sum metrics (i.e. counters in Prometheus) when available (#18201)
  This could be a breaking change if you already have enabled OpenMetrics format for the Prometheus exporter and have enabled exemplar ingestion in your Prometheus scraper.  To ensure names and types are generated correctly according to the OpenMetrics conventions, you should run your collector with `--feature-gates=pkg.translator.prometheus.NormalizeName`
- `filelogreceiver`: Adds ability to parse a file header and parse it as metadata to decorate log entries. (#18198)
  This feature must be activated with the `filelog.allowHeaderMetadataParsing` feature gate.

- `k8sattributesprocessor`: k8sattributesprocessor e2e tests support metric data type. (#18391)
- `k8sattributesprocessor`: Default `container.id` to latest instance unless `k8s.container.restart_count` is specified (#16432)
- `mdatagen`: Turn on the ability to enable/disable resource attributes by embedding MetricsSettings and ResourceAttributesSettings into all scraping receivers as MetricsBuilderConfig (#16373)
  Currently, the only way to add configurative functionality to mdatagen is by using a bunch of WithResourceAttributesSettings options to the constructor.
  This PR changes the first argument to the NewMetricsBuilder constructor to be of type MetricsBuilderConfig,
  which is a new class that wraps both MetricsSettings and ResourceAttributesSettings, and may be (hopefully) easily extended with more
  configuration in the future.

- `prometheusremotewriteexporter`: Export `_created` metric for Summary, Histogram and Monotonic Sum metric points if `StartTimeUnixNano` is set. (#17412, #12426)
  The export of tbe `_created` metric is configurable in the Prometheus remote write exporter. It is disabled by default.
- `clickhouseexporter`: Fix "no such host" error when the DSN hostname contains the database name (#16476)
- `oracledbreceiver`: the resource attribute `oracledb.instance.name` now captures the database name. (#17850)

  This fix will allow the command to work as a static binary without needing reference to the templates on disk.
  
- `pkg/ottl`: Fix issue where IsMatch returned an error if the target val was nil (#17572)
  - Affected components
    - `filterprocessor`
    - `routingprocessor`
    - `transformprocessor`
  
- `batchperresourceattr`: Optimize batch processor attribute and don't reset the caller's instance, instead make a copy of the original resource attributes (#17835)

  If the `_created` metric was present in the Histogram, Summary or Counter
  metric family, only then its values is used to set `StartTimeUnixNano` on the
  relevant OTLP metric and dropped afterwards. Otherwise, it is converted to the
  monotonic OTLP Sum metric.
  This behaviour is disabled by default. Use the `receiver.prometheusreceiver.UseCreatedMetric`
  to enable it.
  
- `exporter/prometheusremotewriteexporter`: Export exemplars for the Monotonic Sum metric. (#17573)
- `windowseventlogreceiver`: Fix panic that can occur when event is larger than current buffer size. (#17879)
- `windowseventlogreceiver`: Fixed a panic that could create an empty buffer due to incorrect use of unsafe pointers in syscall. (#17878)
  Fixed a potential panic due to a syscall indicating a that the event buffer should resize to 0. The next used of that resized buffer would result in an index out of bounds panic.
  
  Also, added a safety check for buffer resize cases that if the syscall indicates it needs the buffer size to be 0, an error will be returned.

## v0.64.0

### 🛑 Breaking changes 🛑

- `pkg/stanza, filelog, journald, syslog, tcplog, udplog, windowseventlog, logstransform`: Remove ability to configure `converter`. (#15696)
  The design of the converter is opaque and its behavior may change in the future.
  Because of this, the `converter` settings are deemed unstable. The actual behavior of the
  converter remains unchanged, but will always use the former default values.

- `exporter/googlemanagedprometheusexporter`: Moved ClientConfig under MetricConfig, and added an option to change the default metric name prefix for advanced use cases. (#10543)
- `pkg/ottl`: Update `ExprFunc`, `Set`, and `Get` to all return errors. (#15649)
- `pkg/ottl`: Change Statement to use `Expr[K]` and `BoolExpr[K]` and for `Statement.Execute` to require `context.Context`. (#15709)
- `tanzuobservabilityexporter`: Add a new metric exporter config(app_tags_excluded) to exclude application resource attrs(application, service.name, cluster, shard) from the metric tags. Rename the config resource_attributes to resource_attrs_included. Build in-house logic in the tanzuobservability exporter and remove the usage of resourcetotelemetry. (#14733)

### 🚩 Deprecations 🚩

- `hostmetricsreceiver`: Introduce renamed process memory metrics (#14327)
  This starts the process of phasing out incorrect metric names:

  - `process.memory.physical_usage`
  - `process.memory.virtual_usage`

  and replacing them with the names adhering to the semantic conventions:

  - `process.memory.usage`
  - `process.memory.virtual`

  At this stage, the new metrics are added, but they are disabled by default.
  See the "Deprecations" section of the Host Metrics receiver's README for details.

# v0.59.0

## 🛑 Breaking changes 🛑
- `elasticsearchreceiver`: Remove direction for metrics. The feature gate: receiver.elasticsearchreceiver.emitMetricsWithoutDirectionAttribute can be set to apply the following (#13258) (#12189)
  - `elasticsearch` metrics:
    - `elasticsearch.node.cluster.io` will become:
      - `elasticsearch.node.cluster.io.received`
      - `elasticsearch.node.cluster.io.sent`
- `kubeletstatsreceiver`: Remove direction for metrics. The feature gate: receiver.kubeletstatsreceiver.emitMetricsWithoutDirectionAttribute can be set to apply the following (#12588) (#12164)
  - `kubeletstats` metrics:
    - `k8s.node.network.io` will become:
      - `k8s.node.network.io.transmit`

    - `k8s.node.network.errors` will become:
      - `k8s.node.network.errors.transmit`
      - `k8s.node.network.errors.receive`
- `processor/metricstransform`: Remove `processor.metricstransformprocessor.UseOTLPDataModel` feature flag. OpenCensus-based implementation is not available anymore.
 (#13405)
- `exporter/mezmoexporter`: This change removes the hardcoded "otel" hostname that was embedded
in outgoing logs data.
 (#13410)
  It is replaced by:

    1. Sending to a new collector endpoint that does not require the
    hostname parameter.

    2. Recognizing the "host.name" resource attribute and using that
    value to fill in log metadata recognized upstream.

    This is a breaking change, and as such will generate a startup
    error if the exporter is configured to send to an endpoint that
    does not support this feature.
