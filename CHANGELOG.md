<!-- next version -->

## v0.64.0

### 🛑 Breaking changes 🛑

- `pkg/stanza, filelog, journald, syslog, tcplog, udplog, windowseventlog, logstransform`: Remove ability to configure `converter`. (#15696)
  The design of the converter is opaque and its behavior may change in the future.
  Because of this, the `converter` settings are deemed unstable. The actual behavior of the
  converter remains unchanged, but will always use the former default values.
  
- `exporter/googlemanagedprometheusexporter`: Moved ClientConfig under MetricConfig, and added an option to change the default metric name prefix for advanced use cases. (#10543)
- `pkg/ottl`: Update `ExprFunc`, `Set`, and `Get` to all return errors. (#15649)
- `pkg/ottl`: Change Statement to use `Expr[K]` and `BoolExpr[K]` and for `Statement.Execute` to require `context.Context`. (#15709)
- `tanzuobservabilityexporter`: Add a new metric exporter config(app_tags_excluded) to exclude application resource attrs(application, service.name, cluster, shard) from the metric tags. Rename the config resource_attributes to resource_attrs_included. Build in-house logic in the tanzuobservability exporter and remove the usage of resourcetotelemetry. (#14733)

### 🚩 Deprecations 🚩

- `hostmetricsreceiver`: Introduce renamed process memory metrics (#14327)
  This starts the process of phasing out incorrect metric names:
  
  - `process.memory.physical_usage`
  - `process.memory.virtual_usage`
  
  and replacing them with the names adhering to the semantic conventions:
  
  - `process.memory.usage`
  - `process.memory.virtual`
  
  At this stage, the new metrics are added, but they are disabled by default.
  See the "Deprecations" section of the Host Metrics receiver's README for details.
  

### 💡 Enhancements 💡

- `awsemfexporter`: Added a `log_retention` field to the config to specify log retention policy for a Cloudwatch Log Group (#15678)

# v0.59.0

## 🛑 Breaking changes 🛑
- `elasticsearchreceiver`: Remove direction for metrics. The feature gate: receiver.elasticsearchreceiver.emitMetricsWithoutDirectionAttribute can be set to apply the following (#13258) (#12189)
  - `elasticsearch` metrics:
    - `elasticsearch.node.cluster.io` will become:
      - `elasticsearch.node.cluster.io.received`
      - `elasticsearch.node.cluster.io.sent`
- `kubeletstatsreceiver`: Remove direction for metrics. The feature gate: receiver.kubeletstatsreceiver.emitMetricsWithoutDirectionAttribute can be set to apply the following (#12588) (#12164)
  - `kubeletstats` metrics:
    - `k8s.node.network.io` will become:
      - `k8s.node.network.io.transmit`
      - `k8s.node.network.io.receive`
    - `k8s.node.network.errors` will become:
      - `k8s.node.network.errors.transmit`
      - `k8s.node.network.errors.receive`
- `processor/metricstransform`: Remove `processor.metricstransformprocessor.UseOTLPDataModel` feature flag. OpenCensus-based implementation is not available anymore.
 (#13405)
- `exporter/mezmoexporter`: This change removes the hardcoded "otel" hostname that was embedded
in outgoing logs data.
 (#13410)
  It is replaced by:

    1. Sending to a new collector endpoint that does not require the
    hostname parameter.

    2. Recognizing the "host.name" resource attribute and using that
    value to fill in log metadata recognized upstream.

    This is a breaking change, and as such will generate a startup
    error if the exporter is configured to send to an endpoint that
    does not support this feature.

This release contains an issue in
[Prometheus receiver](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/prometheusreceiver)
causing 30% memory consumption increase when there is a lot of target churn. The issue is currently being
investigated and will be fixed in one of the new releases. More details:
https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/issues/9278.
