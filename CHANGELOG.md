<!-- next version -->

## v0.106.1

### 🧰 Bug fixes 🧰

- `configauth`: Fix unmarshaling of authentication in HTTP servers. (#34325)
  This brings in a bug fix from the core collector. See https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/issues/10750.

## v0.106.0

### 🛑 Breaking changes 🛑

- `vcenterreceiver`: Enables various vCenter metrics that were disabled by default until v0.106.0 (#33607)
  The following metrics will be enabled by default "vcenter.datacenter.cluster.count", "vcenter.datacenter.vm.count", "vcenter.datacenter.datastore.count",
  "vcenter.datacenter.host.count", "vcenter.datacenter.disk.space", "vcenter.datacenter.cpu.limit", "vcenter.datacenter.memory.limit",
  "vcenter.resource_pool.memory.swapped", "vcenter.resource_pool.memory.ballooned", and "vcenter.resource_pool.memory.granted". The 
  "resourcePoolMemoryUsageAttribute" has also been bumped up to release v.0.107.0
  
- `googlemanagedprometheusexporter`: Fix typo in `exporter.googlemanagedpromethues.intToDouble` feature gate (#34232)

### 🚩 Deprecations 🚩

- `k8sattributesprocessor`: Deprecate `extract.annotations.regex` and `extract.labels.regex` config fields in favor of the `ExtractPatterns` function in the transform processor. The `FieldExtractConfig.Regex` parameter will be removed in version v0.111.0. (#25128)
  Deprecating of FieldExtractConfig.Regex parameter means that it is recommended to use the `ExtractPatterns` function from the transform processor instead. To convert your current configuration please check the `ExtractPatterns` function [documentation](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/pkg/ottl/ottlfuncs#extractpatterns). You should use the `pattern` parameter of `ExtractPatterns` instead of using the `FieldExtractConfig.Regex` parameter.

### 🚀 New components 🚀

- `otlpjsonconnector`: New component that will allow extracting otlpjson data from incoming Logs. (#34239, #34208)
- `redis_storage`: Adds a new storage extension using Redis to store data in transit (#31682)

### 💡 Enhancements 💡

- `processor/transform`: Add `scale_metric` function that scales all data points in a metric. (#16214)
- `vcenterreceiver`: Adds vCenter vSAN host metrics. (#33556)
  Introduces the following vSAN host metrics to the vCenter receiver:
    - vcenter.host.vsan.throughput
    - vcenter.host.vsan.iops
    - vcenter.host.vsan.congestions
    - vcenter.host.vsan.cache.hit_rate
    - vcenter.host.vsan.latency.avg
  
- `transformprocessor`: Support aggregating metrics based on their attributes. (#16224)
- `metricstransformprocessor`: Adds the 'median' aggregation type to the Metrics Transform Processor. Also uses the refactored aggregation business logic from internal/core package. (#16224)

- `otlpjsonconnector`: Add connector's implementations (#34249, #34208)
- `windowsperfcountersreceiver`: Improve handling of non-existing instances for Windows Performance Counters (#33815)
  It is an expected that when querying Windows Performance Counters the targeted instances may not be present.
  The receiver will no longer require the use of `recreate_query` to handle non-existing instances.
  As soon as the instances are available, the receiver will start collecting metrics for them.
  There won't be warning log messages when there are no matches for the configured instances.
  
- `kafkareceiver`: Add settings session_timeout and heartbeat_interval to Kafka Receiver for group management facilities (#28630)

### 🧰 Bug fixes 🧰

- `clickhouseexporter`: Increase the default number of queue consumers to 10 (#34176)
- `opencensusreceiver`: Do not report an error into resource status during receiver shutdown when the listener connection was closed. (#33865)
- `datadogconnector`: Produce stats for non-root client and producer spans when `connector.datadogconnector.NativeIngest` and `compute_top_level_by_span_kind` are enabled (#34197)
  You should have only run into this bug when ALL the conditions below are met | 1. feature gate `connector.datadogconnector.NativeIngest` is enabled | 2. config `compute_top_level_by_span_kind` is set to true | 3. config `compute_stats_by_span_kind` is unset or set to false | 4. you have child spans with client or producer span kind
- `datadogconnector`: Respect `_dd.measured` when `connector.datadogconnector.NativeIngest` is enabled (#34197)
  Spans with attribute `_dd.measured` set to 1 will always get Datadog APM stats
- `deltatocumulativeprocessor`: fix bucket counts when downscaling exp histograms with odd offsets (#33831)
- `otelarrowreceiver`: Fix potential goroutine leak when in stream-shutdown. (#34236)
- `otelarrowreceiver`: Eliminate one spurious span error. (#34175)

- `statsdeceiver`: Log only non-EOF errors when reading payload received via TCP. (#33951)
- `vcenterreceiver`: Adds destroys to the ContainerViews in the client. (#34254)
  This may not be necessary, but it should be better practice than not.

## v0.105.0

### 🛑 Breaking changes 🛑

- `skywalkingexporter`: Remove unmaintained component (#23796)
- `elasticsearchexporter`: Make "dedup" option no-op, always de-duplicate. (#33773)
  Elasticsearch does not permit duplicate keys in JSON objects, so there is no value in being able to configure deduplication.
- `elasticsearchexporter`: Remove defunct "file" and "fields" configuration settings. (#33803)
  This is a breaking change only because removing the attributes would prevent collector startup if those attributes are specified, but otherwise there is no functional change. These configuration attributes have never done anything.
- `stanza`: errors from Operator.Process are returned instead of silently ignored. (#33783)
  This public function is affected: https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/pkg/stanza@v0.104.0/operator/helper#WriterOperator.Write
- `vcenterreceiver`: Enables various vCenter metrics that were disabled by default until v0.105 (#34022)
  The following metrics will be enabled by default "vcenter.host.network.packet.drop.rate",
  "vcenter.vm.cpu.readiness", "vcenter.host.cpu.capacity", and "vcenter.host.cpu.reserved".
  

### 🚩 Deprecations 🚩

- `lokiexporter`: Deprecate component (#33916)

### 🚀 New components 🚀

- `sumconnector`: creates a wireframe and initial pr to develop from (#32669)

### 💡 Enhancements 💡

- `pkg/ottl`: Added Hex() converter function (#31929)
- `pkg/ottl`: Add IsRootSpan() converter function. (#32918)
  Converter `IsRootSpan()` returns `true` if the span in the corresponding context is root, that means its `parent_span_id` equals to hexadecimal representation of zero. In all other scenarios function returns `false`.
- `vcenterreceiver`: Adds additional vCenter resource pool metrics and a memory_usage_type attribute for vcenter.resource_pool.memory.usage metric to use. (#33607)
  Added "vcenter.resource_pool.memory.swapped", "vcenter.resource_pool.memory.ballooned", and "vcenter.resource_pool.memory.granted"
  metrics. Also added an additional attribute, "memory_usage_type" for "vcenter.resource_pool.memory.usage" metric, which is
  currently under a feature gate.
  
- `kubeletstatsreceiver`: Add `k8s.pod.memory.node.utilization` and `k8s.container.memory.node.utilization` metrics (#33591)
- `vcenterreceiver`: Adds vCenter metrics at the datacenter level. (#33607)
  Introduces various datacenter metrics which work by aggregating stats from datastores, clusters, hosts, and VM's.
- `processor/resource, processor/attributes`: Add an option to extract value from a client address by specifying `client.address` value in the `from_context` field. (#34051)
- `awss3receiver`: Add support for retrieving logs and metrics to the AWS S3 Receiver. (#30750)
- `receiver/azuremonitorreceiver`: Add support for Managed Identity and Default Credential auth (#31268, #33584)
- `azuremonitorreceiver`: Add `maximum_number_of_records_per_resource` config parameter in order to overwrite default (#32165)
- `clickhouseexporter`: Upgrading stability for logs to beta (#33615)
  The logs exporter has been proven to be stable for large scale production deployments.
  Configuration options specific to logs are unlikely to change.
  
- `cloudfoundryreceiver`: Add support to receive CloudFoundry Logs (#32671)
- `datadogreceiver`: Add support for metrics in Datadog receiver (#18278)
- `datadogexporter`: Add a feature gate `exporter.datadogexporter.TraceExportUseCustomHTTPClient` that allows a custom HTTP client to be used in trace export (#34025)
  This is an experimental feature. By default the feature gate is disabled and trace export uses a default HTTP client.
- `elasticsearchexporter`: Introduce experimental `telemetry.log_request_body` and `telemetry.log_response_body` config (#33854)
- `cmd/opampsupervisor`: Adds support for forwarding custom messages to/from the agent (#33575)
- `geoipprocessor`: Add providers configuration and maxmind provider factory (#33269)
- `healthcheckv2extension`: Add partial gRPC service implementation to healthcheckv2. (#26661)
- `healthcheckv2extension`: Add support for streaming Watch RPC to healthcheckv2 gRPC service. (#26661)
- `healthcheckv2extension`: Add HTTP service to healthcheckv2 (#26661)
- `splunkhecexporter`: Increase the performance of JSON marshaling (#34011)
- `pkg/stanza`: Add `parse_ints` config in json parser to support parsing int or float properly (#33696)
- `loadbalancingexporter`: Adds a new streamID routingKey, which will route based on the datapoint ID. See updated README for details (#32513)
- `awsxrayexporter`: Allow multiple log group names/arns to be set in environmental variables (#33795)
- `dockerobserver`: Add hint to error when using float for `api_version` field (#34043)
- `dockerstatsreceiver`: Add hint to error when using float for `api_version` field (#34043)
- `pkg/ottl`: Emit traces for statement sequence executions to troubleshoot OTTL statements/conditions (#33433)
- `pkg/stanza`: Bump 'logs.jsonParserArray' and 'logs.assignKeys' feature gates to beta. (#33948)
  This enables the feature gates by default to allow use of the
  `json_array_parser` and `assign_keys` operations.
  
- `receiver/filelog`: Add filelog.container.removeOriginalTimeField feature-flag for removing original time field (#33946)
- `statsdreceiver`: Allow configuring summary percentiles (#33701)
- `pkg/stanza`: Switch to faster json parser lib for container operator (#33929)
- `telemetrygen`: telemetrygen `--rate` flag changed from Int64 to Float64 (#33984)
- `extension/opamp`: Rely on the Collector APIs to do config redaction (#34078)
  Previously all config fields had to be redacted, now `configopaque.String` is used to determine
  which fields should be redacted. As a result, fields that are not sensitive are no longer redacted.
  
- `azuremonitorreceiver`: Upgrade stability to alpha (#33689)
- `windowsperfcountersreceiver`: `windowsperfcountersreceiver` now appends an index number to additional instance names that share a name. An example of this is when scraping ` rocess(*)` counters with multiple running instances of the same executable. (#32319)
  **NOTES**
  - This change can expose cardinality issues where the counters were previously collapsed under the non-indexed instance name.
  - The change mimics Windows Performance Monitor behavior: The first instance name remains unchanged, additional instances are suffixed with `#<N>` where `N=1` and is increased for each duplicate.
    - e.g. Given 3 powershell instances, this will return `powershell`, `powershell#1` and `powershell#2`.

## v0.104.0

### 🛑 Breaking changes 🛑

- `sumologicexporter`: removed compress_encoding (#33604)
- `exporter/clickhouse`: Change behavior of how default database is read from the config (#33693)
  Changed the default `database` to `default`.
  The final database will prioritize `endpoint`, unless `database` is set to a value not equal to `default`.
  If neither are specified then it defaults to the `default` database.
  Possible breaking change if someone has the DSN configured in combination with `database` config option.
  
- `exporter/clickhouse`: Add `async_insert` config option to enable inserting asynchronously by default. (#33614)
  Adds `async_insert` config option to enable inserting asynchronously by default.
  To preserve the previous behavior, set `async_insert` to `false` in your config.
  When enabled, the exporter will insert asynchronously, which can improve performance for high-throughput deployments.
  The `async_insert` option can be set to `true` or `false` to enable or disable async inserts, respectively. The default value is `true`.
  Keep in mind this setting is added since the exporter now sets it to default.
  Async insert and its related settings can still be defined in `endpoint` and `connection_params`, which take priority over the new config option.
  
- `clickhouseexporter`: Add `AggregationTemporality` column to histogram and exponential histogram tables. Rename `AggTemp` column to `AggregationTemporality` in sum table. (#33424)
  It's a breaking change. users who upgrade to the latest version need to alter the Clickhouse table:
  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE otel_metrics_exponential_histogram ADD COLUMN AggregationTemporality Int32 CODEC(ZSTD(1));
  ALTER TABLE otel_metrics_histogram ADD COLUMN AggregationTemporality Int32 CODEC(ZSTD(1));
  ALTER TABLE otel_metrics_sum RENAME COLUMN AggTemp TO AggregationTemporality;
  ```
  
- `exporter/clickhouse`: Remove deprecated `ttl_days` config option, use `ttl` instead. (#33648)
- `vcenterreceiver`: Drops support for vCenter 6.7 (#33607)
- `all`: Promote `component.UseLocalHostAsDefaultHost` feature gate to beta. This changes default endpoints from 0.0.0.0 to localhost (#30702)
  This change affects the following components:
    - extension/awsproxy
    - extension/health_check
    - extension/health_checkv2
    - extension/jaegerremotesampling
    - internal/aws/proxy
    - processor/remotetap
    - receiver/awsfirehose
    - receiver/awsxray
    - receiver/influxdb
    - receiver/jaeger
    - receiver/loki
    - receiver/opencensus
    - receiver/sapm
    - receiver/signalfx
    - receiver/skywalking
    - receiver/splunk_hec
    - receiver/zipkin
    - receiver/zookeeper
  
- `receiver/mongodb`: Graduate receiver.mongodb.removeDatabaseAttr feature gate to stable (#24972)

### 🚩 Deprecations 🚩

- `exporter/elasticsearch`: Deprecate the "dedot" configuration. (#33772)
  dedot has been deprecated, and will always be enabled in ECS mode and disabled for other modes in future
- `exporter/elasticsearch`: Deprecate the "dedup" configuration. (#33773)
  dedup has been deprecated, and will always be enabled in future.

- `k8sobserver`: Add support for k8s.ingress endpoint. (#32971)
- `statsdreceiver`: Optimize statsdreceiver to reduce object allocations (#33683)
- `routingprocessor`: Use mdatagen to define the component's telemetry (#33526)
- `loadbalancerexporter`: Refactors how the load balancing exporter splits metrics (#32513)
  All splitting is *behaviorally*, the same. However, the `resource` routingID now uses the `internal/exp/metrics/identity` package to generate the load balancing key, instead of bespoke code. This means that when upgrading to this version your routes for specific metric groupings could change. However, this will be stable and all future metrics will follow the new routing
- `receiver/mongodbreceiver`: Add `server.address` and `server.port` resource attributes to MongoDB receiver. (#32810, #32350)
  The new resource attributes are added to the MongoDB receiver to distinguish metrics coming from different MongoDB instances.
    - `server.address`: The address of the MongoDB host, enabled by default.
    - `server.port`: The port of the MongoDB host, disabled by default.

  `sqlserver.batch.sql_compilation.rate`
  `sqlserver.batch.sql_recompilation.rate`
  `sqlserver.page.buffer_cache.hit_ratio`
  `sqlserver.user.connection.count`
  
- `extension/googleclientauth`: Add Google-signed ID token support (#33185)
  Update github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/opentelemetry-operations-go/extension/googleclientauth to v0.48.0.
  With this update, extension/googleclientauth now supports Google-signed ID token as auth header.
  
- `vcenterreceiver`: Adds vCenter CPU capacity and network drop rate metrics to hosts. (#33607)

### 🧰 Bug fixes 🧰

- `resourcedetectionprocessor`: Fetch CPU info only if related attributes are enabled (#33774)
- `datasetexporter`: Upgrade dataset-go to v0.19.0 and fix found issues (#33498, #32533, #33675)
  Upgrade `dataset-go` library from v0.18.0 to v0.19.0.
  Enable skipped integration test and adjust the test so it is passing again.
  Do not validate configuration, let the framework run the validation.
  
- `datasetexporter`: Upgrade dataset-go to v0.20.0 (#33812)
  Upgrade `dataset-go` library from v0.19.0 to v0.20.0.
  Make number of outgoing connections configurable.
  
- `datadogexporter`: Fix panics on invalid sized trace & span IDs (#33566)
  See https://github.com/DataDog/opentelemetry-mapping-go/pull/340 for details.
- `datadogexporter`: Ignore metric datapoints with `no recorded value` flag (#33728)
  This flag is not supported by Datadog, so we just ignore these datapoints. See https://github.com/DataDog/opentelemetry-mapping-go/pull/330 for details.
- `tailsamplingprocessor`: Fix precedence of inverted match in and policy (#33671)
  Previously if the decision from a policy evaluation was `NotSampled` or `InvertNotSampled` it would return a `NotSampled` decision regardless, effectively downgrading the result.
  
  This was breaking the documented behaviour that inverted decisions should take precedence over all others.
  
- `otelarrowreceiver`: Ensure consume operations are not canceled at stream EOF. (#33570)
- `vcenterreceiver`: Fixes errors in some of the client calls for environments containing multiple datacenters. (#33734)

## v0.103.0

### 🛑 Breaking changes 🛑

- `cmd/opampsupervisor,extension/opamp`: Upgrade the opamp-go library to v0.15.0 (#33416)
  With this change, UUIDv7 is recommended for the OpAMP extension's instance_uid field instead of ULID. ULIDs will continue to work, but may be displayed as UUIDs.
  The supervisor's persistent state (${storage_dir}/persistent_state.yaml) will need to be cleared to generate a new UUIDv7 instead of a ULID.
  This change may be incompatible with management servers using v0.14.0 of opamp-go.
  
- `mongodbreceiver`: Now only supports `TCP` connections (#32199)
  This fixes a bug where hosts had to explicitly set `tcp` as the transport type. The `transport` option has been removed.
- `cmd/configschema`: Removes the deprecated `configschema` command. This command will no longer be released or supported. (#33384)
- `sqlserverreceiver`: sqlserver.database.io.read_latency has been renamed to sqlserver.database.latency with a `direction` attribute. (#29865)

### 🚩 Deprecations 🚩

- `healthcheckextension`: Remove incorrect logic behind `check_collector_pipeline` config (#33469)
  This logic incorrectly set the pipeline to OK after waiting for enough callbacks from the
  opencensus library to be called. As this was broken, I'm removing it to remove the dependency
  on opencensus as well. Improvements will be available via healthcheckv2 extension.
  
- `googlecloudspannerreceiver`: Mark the component as unmaintained. If we don't find new maintainers, it will be deprecated and removed. (#32651)

### 💡 Enhancements 💡

- `filelogreceiver`: If include_file_record_number is true, it will add the file record number as the attribute `log.file.record_number` (#33530)
- `kubeletstats`: Add k8s.pod.cpu.node.utilization metric (#33390)
- `awss3exporter`: endpoint should contain the S3 bucket (#32774)

- `elasticsearchexporter`: Add support for confighttp options, notably "auth". (#33367)
  Add support for confighttp and related configuration settings, such as "auth".
  This change also means that the Elasticsearch URL may be specified as "endpoint",
  like the otlphttp exporter.
  
- `elasticsearchexporter`: Check that endpoints are valid URLs during config validation. (#33350)
  Check that endpoints are valid URLs during config validation so that
  an invalid endpoint causes a fatal error during startup, rather than
  leading to a persistent runtime error.
  
- `opampsupervisor`: Add config validation for the supervisor config (#32843)
- `statsdreceiver`: Added received/accepted/refused metrics (#24278)
- `filelogreceiver`: Add support for gzip compressed log files (#2328)
- `confmap/provider/secretsmanagerprovider`: Add support for JSON formatted secrets in secretsmanagerprovider confmap (#32143)
  The `secretsmanagerprovider` confmap will now allow to get secret by a json key if the secret value is json.
  To specify key separate key from secret name/arn by `#` e.g. `mySecret#mySecretKey`.
  
- `geoipprocessor`: Add initial processing based on source.address resource attribute (#32663)
- `healthcheckv2extension`: Add shared aggregation logic for status events. (#26661)
- `tailsamplingprocessor`: Simple LRU Decision Cache for "keep" decisions (#31583)
- `processor/tailsampling`: Migrates internal telemetry to OpenTelemetry SDK via mdatagen (#31581)
  The metric names and their properties, such as bucket boundaries for histograms, were kept like before, to keep backwards compatibility.
- `kafka`: Added `disable_fast_negotiation` configuration option for Kafka Kerberos authentication, allowing the disabling of PA-FX-FAST negotiation. (#26345)
- `pkg/ottl`: Added `keep_matching_keys` function to allow dropping all keys from a map that don't match the pattern. (#32989)

- `probabilisticsamplerprocessor`: Add Proportional and Equalizing sampling modes (#31918)
  Both the existing hash_seed mode and the two new modes use OTEP 235 semantic conventions to encode sampling probability.
- `prometheusreceiver`: Resource attributes produced by the prometheus receiver now include stable semantic conventions for `server` and `url`. (#32814)
  To migrate from the legacy net.host.name, net.host.port, and http.scheme resource attributes, |
  migrate to server.address, server.port, and url.scheme, and then |
  set the receiver.prometheus.removeLegacyResourceAttributes feature gate.
  
- `datadogexporter`: The Datadog Exporter now supports the `proxy_url` parameter to configure an HTTP proxy to use when sending telemetry to Datadog. (#33316)
- `spanmetrics`: Produce delta temporality span metrics with StartTimeUnixNano and TimeUnixNano values representing an uninterrupted series (#31671, #30688)
  This allows producing delta span metrics instead of the more memory-intensive cumulative metrics, specifically when a downstream component can convert the delta metrics to cumulative.
- `sqlserverreceiver`: Add support for more Database IO metrics (#29865)
  The following metrics have been added:
  - sqlserver.database.latency
  - sqlserver.database.io
  - sqlserver.database.operations
  
- `cmd/opampsupervisor`: Receive and report effective config to the OpAMP server (#30622)
- `processor/transform`: Add `transform.flatten.logs` featuregate to give each log record a distinct resource and scope. (#32080)
  This option is useful when applying transformations which alter the resource or scope. e.g. `set(resource.attributes["to"], attributes["from"])`, which may otherwise result in unexpected behavior. Using this option typically incurs a performance penalty as the processor must compute many hashes and create copies of resource and scope information for every log record.
  
- `receiver/windowsperfcounters`: Counter configuration now supports recreating the underlying performance query at scrape time. (#32798)

### 🧰 Bug fixes 🧰

- `filelogreceiver`: Container parser should add k8s metadata as resource attributes and not as log record attributes (#33341)
- `deltatocumulative`: properly drop samples when at limit (#33285)
  fixes a segfault in the limiting behavior, where streams exceeding the limit still had their samples processed. due to not being tracked, this led to a nil-pointer deref

## v0.102.0

### 🛑 Breaking changes 🛑

- `k8sattributesprocessor`: Move `k8sattr.rfc3339` feature gate to stable. (#33304)
- `extension/opamp`: Redact all values in the effective config (#33267)
  All values will be treated as if they are a `configopaque.String` type. This will
  be changed once the Collector APIs are updated to unmarshal the config while
  only redacting actual `configopaque.String`-typed values.
  
  The exception to redaction is the `service::pipelines` section, which is useful
  for debugging and does not contain any `configopaque.String` values.
  
- `extension/filestorage`: Replace path-unsafe characters in component names (#3148)
  The feature gate `extension.filestorage.replaceUnsafeCharacters` is now removed.
- `vcenterreceiver`: vcenterreceiver replaces deprecated packet metrics by removing them and enabling by default the newer ones. (#32929, #32835)
  Removes the following metrics: `vcenter.host.network.packet.errors`, `vcenter.host.network.packet.count`, and
  `vcenter.vm.network.packet.count`. 
  
  Also enables by default the following metrics: `vcenter.host.network.packet.error.rate`,
  `vcenter.host.network.packet.rate`, and `vcenter.vm.network.packet.rate`.

- `groupbytraceprocessor`: Fix groupbytrace metrics contain duplicate prefix (#32698)
- `vcenterreceiver`: Removes `vcenter.cluster.name` attribute from `vcenter.datastore` metrics (#32674)
  If there were multiple Clusters, Datastore metrics were being repeated under Resources differentiated with a
  `vcenter.cluster.name` resource attribute. In the same vein, if there were standalone Hosts, in addition to
  clusters the metrics would be repeated under a Resource without the `vcenter.cluster.name` attribute. Now there
  will only be a single set of metrics for one Datastore (as there should be, as Datastores don't belong to
  Clusters).

### 🧰 Bug fixes 🧰

- `deltatocumulativeprocessor`: Evict only stale streams (#33014)
  Changes eviction behavior to only evict streams that are actually stale.
  Currently, once the stream limit is hit, on each new stream the oldest tracked one is evicted.
  Under heavy load this can rapidly delete all streams over and over, rendering the processor useless.
  
- `elasticsearchexporter`: Retried docs are no longer included in failed docs in an edge case where all errors are retriable (#33092)
  Update dep go-docappender to 2.1.2.
  This fixes the bug when all errors are retriable in bulk request response, retried docs will be included in failed docs.

- `pkg/ottl`: Fixes a bug where function name could be used in a condition, resulting in a cryptic error message. (#33051)

## v0.100.0

### 🛑 Breaking changes 🛑

- `receiver/hostmetrics`: enable feature gate `receiver.hostmetrics.normalizeProcessCPUUtilization` (#31368)
  This changes the value of the metric `process.cpu.utilization` by dividing it by the number of CPU cores.
  For example, if a process is using 2 CPU cores on a 16-core machine,
  the value of this metric was previously `2`, but now it will be `0.125`.
  
- `testbed`: Remove deprecated `GetAvailablePort` function (#32800)

### 🚀 New components 🚀

- `exporter/kafkaexporter`: Enable setting message topics using resource attributes. (#31178)
- `exporter/datadog`: Introduces the Datadog Agent logs pipeline for exporting logs to Datadog under the "exporter.datadogexporter.UseLogsAgentExporter" feature gate. (#32327)
- `elasticsearchexporter`: Add retry.retry_on_status config (#32584)
  Previously, the status codes that trigger retries were hardcoded to be 429, 500, 502, 503, 504.
  It is now configurable using `retry.retry_on_status`, and defaults to `[429, 500, 502, 503, 504]` to avoid a breaking change.
  To avoid duplicates, it is recommended to configure `retry.retry_on_status` to `[429]`, which would be the default in a future version.
  
- `exporter/splunkhec`: add experimental exporter batcher config (#32545)
- `windowsperfcountersreceiver`: Returns partial errors for failures during scraping to prevent throwing out all successfully retrieved metrics (#16712)

- `ptracetest`: Add support for ignore scope span instrumentation scope information (#32852)
- `sqlserverreceiver`: Enable direct connection to SQL Server (#30297)
  Directly connecting to SQL Server will enable the receiver to gather more metrics
  for observing the SQL Server instance. The first metric added with this update is
  `sqlserver.database.io.read_latency`.
  
- `connector/datadog`: The Datadog connector now has a config option to identify top-level spans by span kind. This new logic can be enabled by setting `traces::compute_top_level_by_span_kind` to true in the Datadog connector config. Default is false. (#32005)
  `traces::compute_top_level_by_span_kind` needs to be enabled in both the Datadog connector and Datadog exporter configs if both components are being used.
  With this new logic, root spans and spans with a server or consumer `span.kind` will be marked as top-level. Additionally, spans with a client or producer `span.kind` will have stats computed.
  Enabling this config option may increase the number of spans that generate trace metrics, and may change which spans appear as top-level in Datadog.
  
- `exporter/datadog`: The Datadog exporter now has a config option to identify top-level spans by span kind. This new logic can be enabled by setting `traces::compute_top_level_by_span_kind` to true in the Datadog exporter config. Default is false. (#32005)

### 🧰 Bug fixes 🧰

- `awscloudwatchreceiver`: The receiver now supports extracting data from named loggroups without requiring filters for log streams. This was already advertised as feature, but ignored during initialization. (#32345)
- `awskinesisexporter`: Wraps the `AssumeRoleProvider` in a `CachedCredentials` provider, in the case the AWS role is specified. This prevents a role assumption from happening every API call. (#32415)
- `receiver/hostmetricsreceiver`: do not extract the cpu count if the metric is not enabled; this will prevent unnecessary overhead, especially on windows (#32133)

- `podmanreceiver`: Adds metrics and resources metadata and sets seconds precision for cpu metrics (#28640)
- `clickhouseexporter`: Add ServiceName as `column` into Clickhouse metrics tables (#31670)
  It's a breaking change. users who upgrade to the latest version need to alter the Clickhouse table:
  ```sql

  ALTER TABLE otel_metrics_gauge ADD COLUMN ServiceName LowCardinality(String) CODEC(ZSTD(1));
  ALTER TABLE otel_metrics_histogram ADD COLUMN ServiceName LowCardinality(String) CODEC(ZSTD(1));

  Breaking change if mapping `mode` is set to `ecs`, use `none` to maintain existing format
- `pkg/stanza`: Revert recombine operator's 'overwrite_with' default value. (#30783)
  Restores the previous the default value of `oldest`, meaning that the recombine operator will emit the
  first entry from each batch (with the recombined field). This fixes the bug introduced by 30783 and restores
  the default setting so as to effectively cancel out the bug for users who were not using this setting.
  For users who were explicitly setting `overwrite_with`, this corrects the intended behavior.
  
- `processor/attributes, processor/resource`: Remove stable coreinternal.attraction.hash.sha256 feature gate. (#31997)

  In the past, X-Ray doesn’t support “.”. So we have a translator in x-ray export to translates it to “_” before sending traces to X-Ray Service. | To match otel naming style, x-ray service team decide to change their service to support both "." type and "" type of naming. In this case the translator that translate "." to "" is no-longer needed. This PR change the way this translator work | X-Ray PMs agree on rolling out this change by using feature-gate

  the receiver will now read from `otlp_logs` or `otlp_metrics` topic instead of `otlp_spans` topic.
  To maintain previous behavior, set the `topic` property to `otlp_spans`.
  
- `pkg/stanza`: Entries are no longer logged during error conditions. (#26670)
  This change is being made to ensure sensitive information contained in logs are never logged inadvertently.
  This change is a breaking change because it may change user expectations. However, it should require
  no action on the part of the user unless they are relying on logs from a few specific error cases.
  
- `pkg/stanza`: Invert recombine operator's 'overwrite_with' default value. (#30783)
  Previously, the default value was `oldest`, meaning that the recombine operator _should_ emit the
  first entry from each batch (with the recombined field). However, the actual behavior was inverted.
  This fixes the bug but also inverts the default setting so as to effectively cancel out the bug fix
  for users who were not using this setting. For users who were explicitly setting `overwrite_with`,
  this corrects the intended behavior.

  `Attributes` object. Similarly, this setting will also result in traces being
  indexed into Elasticsearch with their event fields directly at the root level
  of the document instead of inside an `Events` object.

  a source was emitted before a matching "start of log" indicator was found. This could also
  occur when the collector was shutting down.
  
- `pkg/stanza`: Fix bug where recombine operator's 'overwrite_with' condition was inverted. (#30783)
- `exporter/signalfx`: Use "unknown" value for the environment correlation calls as fallback. (#31052)

  string "Z" to signify UTC time, as required by ISO 8601. Now, both
  `+0000` and `Z` are recognized as UTC times in all components that
  handle `strptime` format strings.

- `hostmetricsreceiver`: Add optional Linux-only metric `system.linux.memory.available` (#7417)
  This is an alternative to `system.memory.usage` metric with `state=free`.
  Linux starting from 3.14 exports "available" memory. It takes "free" memory as a baseline, and then factors in kernel-specific values.
  This is supposed to be more accurate than just "free" memory.

- `filelogreceiver`: Change "Started watching file" log behavior (#28491)
  Previously, every unique file path which was found by the receiver would be remembered indefinitely.
  This list was kept independently of the uniqueness / checkpointing mechanism (which does not rely on the file path).
  The purpose of this list was to allow us to emit a lot whenever a path was seen for the first time.
  This removes the separate list and relies instead on the same mechanism as checkpointing. Now, a similar log is emitted
  any time a file is found which is not currently checkpointed. Because the checkpointing mechanism does not maintain history
  indefintiely, it is now possible that a log will be emitted for the same file path. This will happen when no file exists at
  the path for a period of time.
  
- `dockerstatsreceiver`: cpu.container.percent metric is removed in favor of container.cpu.utilization (#21807)
  The metric `container.cpu.percentage` is now removed. `container.cpu.utilization` is enabled by default as a replacement.
  For details, see the [docs](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/dockerstatsreceiver#transition-to-cpu-utilization-metric-name-aligned-with-opentelemetry-specification).

- `processor/routing`: When using attributes instead of resource attributes, the routing processor would crash the collector. This does not affect the connector version of this component. (#26462)
- `awsemfexporter`: Fix possible panic in when configuration option `awsemf.output_destination:stdout` is set (#26250)
- `snmpreceiver`: Fix how to determine how many RAs on a metric are scalar (#26363)
  We now create the proper number of resources for configurations where a resource uses fewer than the available number of scalar resource attribtues.
- `processor/tailsampling`: Added saving instrumentation library information for tail-sampling (#13642)
- `receiver/kubeletstats`: Fixes client to refresh service account token when authenticating with kubelet (#26120)
- `datadogexporter`: Fixes crash when mapping OTLP Exponential Histograms with no buckets. These will now be dropped instead. (#26103)
- `filelogreceiver`: Fix the behavior of the add operator to continue to support EXPR(env("MY_ENV_VAR")) expressions (#26373)
- `snmpreceiver`: SNMP values of type Counter64 were seen as unsupported, because the returned data type unint64 was unhandeled. (#23897, #26119)
- `pkg/stanza`: Fix issue unsupported type 'syslog_parser' (#26452)

## v0.84.0

### 🛑 Breaking changes 🛑

- `jaegerreceiver`: Deprecate remote_sampling config in the jaeger receiver (#24186)
  The jaeger receiver will fail to start if remote_sampling config is specified in it.  The `receiver.jaeger.DisableRemoteSampling` feature gate can be set to let the receiver start and treat  remote_sampling config as no-op. In a future version this feature gate will be removed and the receiver will always  fail when remote_sampling config is specified.
  
- `googlecloudexporter`: remove retry_on_failure from the googlecloud exporter. The exporter itself handles retries, and retrying can cause issues. (#57233)
- `vcenterreceiver`: Dimensions performance metrics into metric attribute `object` (#25147)
  The following metrics have been effected to include the new metric attribute to properly dimension the data.`vcenter.vm.network.throughput`,`vcenter.vm.network.usage`,`vcenter.vm.network.packet.count`,`vcenter.vm.disk.latency.avg`,`vcenter.vm.disk.latency.max`,`vcenter.host.network.usage`,`vcenter.host.network.throughput`,`vcenter.host.network.packet.count`,`vcenter.host.network.packet.errors`,
  `vcenter.host.disk.latency.avg`,`vcenter.host.disk.latency.max`, and `vcenter.host.disk.throughput`. More information on how to migrate can be found at https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/vcenterreceiver#feature-gates

### 🛑 Breaking changes 🛑

- `receiver/k8scluster`: Unify predefined and custom node metrics. (#24776)
  - Update metrics description and units to be consistent
  - Remove predefined metrics definitions from metadata.yaml because they are controlled by `node_conditions_to_report` 
    and `allocatable_types_to_report` config options.
  
- `prometheusexporter`: Remove invalid unit translations from the prometheus exporters (#24647)
- `receiver/prometheusexec`: Removes the deprecated prometheus_exec receiver (#24740)

- `gitproviderreceiver`: Add the skeleton for the new gitproviderreceiver in development with accompanying github scraper. (#22028)

### 💡 Enhancements 💡

- `azuredataexplorerexporter`: Add support for managed identity. This enables users to not use Key based authentication (#21924)
- `awsemfexporter`: Add awsemf.nodimrollupdefault feature gate to aws emf exporter (#23997)
  Enabling the awsemf.nodimrollupdefault will cause the AWS EMF Exporter to use the NoDimensionRollup configuration
  setting by default instead of ZeroAndSingleDimensionRollup.

- `prometheusreceiver`: Don't drop histograms without buckets (#22070)
- `pkg/ottl`: Add a new Function Getter to the OTTL package, to allow passing Converters as literal parameters. (#22961)
  Currently OTTL provides no way to use any defined Converter within another Editor/Converter.
  Although Converters can be passed as a parameter, they are always executed and the result is what is actually passed as the parameter.
  This allows OTTL to pass Converters themselves as a parameter so they can be executed within the function.
  
- `resourcedetectionprocessor`: GCP resource detection processor can automatically add `gcp.gce.instance.hostname` and `gcp.gce.instance.name` attributes. (#24598)
- `splunkhecexporter`: Add heartbeat check while startup and new config param, heartbeat/startup (defaults to false). This is different than the healtcheck_startup, as the latter doesn't take token or index into account. (#24411)
- `hostmetricsreceiver`: Report  logical and physical number of CPUs as metric. (#22099)
  Use the `system.cpu.logical.count::enabled` and `system.cpu.physical.count::enabled` flags to enable them

### 🧰 Bug fixes 🧰

- `receiver/sshcheck`: Add the SSH endpoint as a resource attribute (#24441)
- `awsemfexporter`: Enforce time to live on metric data that is stored for the purpose of cumulative to delta conversions within EMF Exporter (#25058)
  This change fixes a bug where the cache used to store metric information for cumulative to delta
  conversions was not enforcing its time to live. This could cause excessive memory growth in certain scenarios which could
  lead to OOM failures for Collector. To properly fix this issue package global metric caches were removed and replaced
  with caches that are unique per emf exporter. A byproduct of this change is that no two emf exporters within an 
  Collector will share a caches leading to more accurate cumulative to delta conversions. 
  
- `awsemfexporter`: Add retain_initial_value_of_delta_metric to translateOTelToGroupedMetric, allowing the initial set of metrics to be published (#24051)
- `carbonreceiver`: Fix Carbon receiver obsrecv operations memory leak (#24275)
  The carbonreceiver has a memory leak where it will repeatedly open new obsrecv operations but not close them afterwards. Those operations eventually create a burden.
  
  The fix is to make sure the receiver only creates an operation per interaction over TCP.
  
- `datadogexporter`: Populate OTLP resource attributes in Datadog logs. Changes mapping for `jvm.loaded_classes` from `process.runtime.jvm.classes.loaded` to `process.runtime.jvm.classes.current_loaded`. (#24674)
- `datadogexporter`: Fix the population of Datadog `system.*` metrics. Ensure the average is within [min, max] in histograms. (#25071)
  The minimum and maximum estimation is only used when the minimum and maximum are not available in the OTLP payload or this is a cumulative payload.
- `pkg/stanza`: Create a new decoder for each TCP/UDP connection to prevent concurrent write to buffer. (#24980)
- `exporter/kafkaexporter`: Fixes a panic when SASL configuration is not present (#24797)
- `lokitranslator, lokiexporter`: Fixes a panic that occurred during the promotion of nested attributes containing dots to labels (#25125)
- `awsxrayexporter`: Fix X-Ray Segment status code and exception translations. (#24381)
- `receiver/haproxy`: Make sure emitted resource metrics have distinct resources by default (#24921)
  This is done by enabling and renaming the following resource attributes:
    - proxy_name -> haproxy.proxy_name
    - service_name -> haproxy.service_name
  
- `receiver/k8sobjects`: Fix bug where duplicate data would be ingested for watch mode if the client connection got reset. (#24806)
- `datadogreceiver`: Fixed NPE on failed to decode message path (#24562)
- `zipkinreceiver`: Respects zipkin's serialised status tags to be converted to span status (#14965)
- `datadogexporter`: Correctly set metrics exporter capabilities to state that it mutates data (#24908)
  This could lead to random panics if using more than one metrics exporter.
  
- `processor/resourcedetection`: Do not drop all system attributes if `host.id` cannot be fetched. (#24669)
- `signalfxexporter`: convert vmpage_io* translated metrics to pages (#25064)
- `splunkhecreceiver`: aligns success resp body w/ splunk enterprise (#19219)
  changes resp from plaintext "ok" to json {"text"："success", "code"：0}

## v0.82.0

### 🛑 Breaking changes 🛑

- `receiver/awsfirehose`: Change the type of `Config.AccessKey` to be `configopaque.String` (#17273)
- `receiver/cloudfoundry`: Change the type of `Config.UAA.Password` to be `configopaque.String` (#17273)
- `exporter/datasetexporter`: Remove temporary client side attribute aggregation and corresponding traces.max_wait and traces.aggregate config options which are now redundant. (#20660)
  This pull request removes the following attributes from the DataSet trace events: services, 
  span_count, error_count. Those attributes were populated on the client side as part of the client
  side aggregation code. This client side aggregation was meant as a temporary solution until a
  proper solution is implement on the server side. Being a temporary solution meant it had many
  edge cases and would only work under specific and limited circumstances (all spans which belong
  to a trace are part of the same batch received by the plugin).
  
  Corresponding config options (traces.aggregate and traces.max_wait) which are not redundant and
  unused have also been removed.
  
- `mysqlreceiver`: removing `mysql.locked_connects` metric which is replaced by `mysql.connection.errors` (#23211)
- `pkg/ottl`: Allow access to the metrics slice in the metric context (#24446)
  This is only a breaking change for users using OTTL in custom components. For all Contrib components this is an enhancement.
- `pkg/stanza`: Make fileconsumer.PositionalScanner internal (#23999)
- `pkg/stanza`: Make fileconsumer.Fingerprint internal (#23998)
- `receiver/httpcheck`: Fail fast on endpoint missing scheme (#23020)
  Previously, when configured with an endpoint without HTTP/HTTPS scheme like "opentelemetry.io",
  the receiver would start correctly, but fail to check the endpoint, producing the `httpcheck.error`
  metric on every collection interval. After this change, the receiver fails to start, writing
  an error log saying that you need to provide a scheme in the endpoint.
  
- `receiver/jmx`: Change the types of `Config.{Password,KeystorePassword,TruststorePassword}` to be `configopaque.String` (#17273)
- `httpcheckreceiver`: support scraping multiple targets (#18823)
- `resourcedetectionprocessor`: Disable `host.id` by default on the `system` detector. This restores the behavior prior to v0.72.0 when using the `system` detector together with other detectors that set `host.id` (#21233)
  To re-enable `host.id` on the `system` detector set `system::resource_attributes::host.id::enabled` to `true`:  
  
  ```
  resourcedetection:
    detectors: [system]
    system:
      resource_attributes:
        host.id:
          enabled: true
  ```

- `receiver/postgresql`: Change the type of `Config.Password` to be `configopaque.String` (#17273)
- `prometheusreciever`: Remove unused buffer_period and buffer_count configuration options (#24258)
- `prometheusreceiver`: Add the `trim_metric_suffixes` configuration option to allow enable metric suffix trimming. (#21743, #8950)
  When enabled, suffixes for unit and type are trimmed from metric names. 
  If you previously enabled the `pkg.translator.prometheus.NormalizeName` 
  feature gate, you will need to enable this option to have suffixes trimmed.
  
- `receiver/pulsar`: Change the types of `Config.Authentication.Token.Token` and `Config.Authentication.Athenz.PrivateKey` to be `configopaque.String` (#17273)
- `receiver/rabbitmq`: Change the type of `Config.Password` to be `configopaque.String` (#17273)

- `receiver/saphana`: Change the type of `Config.Password` to be `configopaque.String` (#17273)
- `receiver/snmp`: Change the types of the `Config.{AuthPassword,PrivacyPassword}` fields to be of `configopaque.String` (#17273)
- `receiver/snowflake`: Change the type of `Config.Password` to be `configopaque.String` (#17273)
- `receiver/solace`: Change the type of `Config.Auth.PlainText.Password` to be `configopaque.String` (#17273)
- `spanmetricsconnector`: Histograms will not have exemplars by default (#23872)
  Previously spanmetricsconnector would attach every single span as an exemplar to the histogram.
  Exemplars are now disabled by default. To enable them set `exemplars::enabled=true`
  
- `receiver/vcenter`: Change the type of `Config.Password` to be `configopaque.String` (#17273)

- `processor/resourcedetection`: Fix Heroku config option for the `service.name` and `service.version` attributes (#24355)
  `service.name` and `service.version` attributes were mistakenly controlled by `heroku.app.name` and
  `heroku.release.version` options under `resource_attributes` configuration introduced in 0.81.0. 
  This PR fixes the issue by using the correct config options named the same as the attributes.
- `processor/resourcedetection`: make sure to use a aks config struct instead of nil to avoid collector panic (#24549)
- `filelogreceiver`: Fix issue where files were deduplicated unnecessarily (#24235)
- `processor/tailsamplingprocessor`: Fix data race when accessing spans during policies evaluation (#24283)
- `zipkintranslator`: Stop dropping error tags from Zipkin spans. The old code removes all errors from those spans, rendering them useless if an actual error happened. In addition, no longer delete error tags if they contain useful information. (#16530)

  cgroup version mounted in the host is v2 instead of v1.
  
  Now there is documentation of which metrics are available depending cgroups version being used on the host.
  

### 🚩 Deprecations 🚩

- `mysqlreceiver`: set `mysql.locked_connects` as optional in order to remove it in next release (#14138, #23274)

### 💡 Enhancements 💡

- `mdatagen`: Adds a parent field to metadata.yaml for subcomponents. (#23636)
- `sqlqueryreceiver`: Add support of Start and End Timestamp Column in Metric Configuration. (#18925, #14146)
- `postgresqlreceiver`: Adds unit to metrics where this was missing. (#23571)
  Affected metrics can be found below.

- `hostmetricsreceiver`: Add new Windows-exclusive process.handles metric. (#21379)
- `websocketprocessor`: Rename websocketprocessor to remoteobserverprocessor (#23856)
- `resourcedetectionprocessor`: Adds a way to configure the list of added resource attributes by the processor (#21482)
  Users can now configure what resource attributes are gathered by specific detectors.
  Example configuration:
  
  ```
  resourcedetection:
    detectors: [system, ec2]
    system:
      resource_attributes:
        host.name:
          enabled: true
        host.id:
          enabled: false
    ec2:
      resource_attributes:
        host.name:
          enabled: false
        host.id:
          enabled: true
  ```
  
  For example, this config makes `host.name` being set by `system` detector, and `host.id` by `ec2` detector.
  Moreover:
  - Existing behavior remains unaffected as all attributes are currently enabled by default.
  - The default attributes 'enabled' values are defined in `metadata.yaml`.
  - Future releases will introduce changes to resource_attributes `enabled` values.
  - Users can tailor resource detection process to their needs and environment.
  
- `spanmetricsconnector`: Added disabling options for histogram metrics and option to exclude default labels from all metrics. In some cases users want to optionally disable part of metrics because they generate too much data or are not needed. (#16344)
- `statsdreceiver`: All receivers are setting receiver name and version when sending data. This change introduces the same behaviour to the statsd receiver. (#23563)
- `zookeeperreceiver`: Adds an additional health check metric based off of the response from the zookeeper ruok 4lw command. (#21481)
- `k8sclusterreceiver`: Switch k8s.pod and k8s.container metrics to use pdata. (#23441)

### 🧰 Bug fixes 🧰

- `mongodbreceiver`: Fix missing version in mongodb creating panics during scrapes (#23859)
- `postgresqlreceiver`: fixed an issue where postgresql receiver was emitting the same attribute value "toast_hit" twice under postgresql.blocks_read metric. (#23657)
- `windowseventlogreceiver`: Fix buffer overflow when ingesting large raw Events (#23677)

- `nginxreceiver`: Bump 'receiver.nginx.emitConnectionsCurrentAsSum' featuregate to beta (enabled by default) (#4326)
- `servicegraphprocessor`: Change metric names to match the spec (#18743, #16578)
  Latency metric `traces_service_graph_request_duration_seconds` are deprecated in favor of server and client metrics | `traces_service_graph_server_request_seconds` and `traces_service_graph_client_request_seconds` | respectively. Use the feature gate `processor.servicegraph.legacyLatencyMetricNames` to enable the old metric names.
- `prometheusreceiver, prometheusexporter, prometheusremotewrite`: Disable `pkg.translator.prometheus.NormalizeName` feature gate by default (#23208)
  The feature gate `pkg.translator.prometheus.NormalizeName` was enabled prematurely while translation
  on the prometheus receiver was incomplete. To address this, the feature gate has been reverted back to alpha status.
  This will remain the case until the translation on the receiver side aligns with the translation on the exporter side,
  or until it is replaced with a configuration option or completely removed. To maintain the current behavior, you can
  enable the feature gate using the `--feature-gates=pkg.translator.prometheus.NormalizeName` command argument. 
  However, please note that the translation in the prometheus receiver is a subject to future changes.

  This is only a breaking change for users using OTTL in custom components. For all Contrib components this is an enhancement.
- `postgresqlreceiver`: Remove resource attribute feature gates (#22479)

### 🚩 Deprecations 🚩

- `dockerstatsreceiver`: cpu.container.percent metric will be deprecated in v0.79.0 in favor of container.cpu.utilization (#21807)
  This starts the process of phasing out incorrect metric name:
  - `container.cpu.utilization`
  and replacing it with the names adhering to the semantic conventions:
  - `container.cpu.percent`
  At this stage, the new metric is added, but is disabled by default.
  See the "Deprecations" section of the Docker Stats receiver's README for details.

  The compression used to be enabled only if the payload size was greater than 1.5KB which significantly
  complicated the logic and made it hard to test. This change makes the compression unconditionally applied to 
  the payload if it's enabled in the config. The benchmarking shows improvements in the throughput and CPU usage for 
  large payloads and expected degradation for small payloads which is acceptable given that it's not a common case.

## v0.73.0

### 🛑 Breaking changes 🛑

- `googlecloudexporter`: Disable retry helper by default in GCP and GMP exporter configs. (#19203)
- `k8sattributesprocessor`: Remove `container.id` as default metadata given possible ambiguity matching a container run to a container ID (#16432)
- `pkg/ottl`: Ability to reference matched capture groups in `replace_pattern()` and `replace_all_patterns()` (#18610)
  This change affects all processors that use OTTL (i.e. `transformprocessor`, `routingprocessor`, and `filterprocessor`).
  This is a breaking change in the rare scenario that the `$` character is currently used in a replacement string.
  To output a literal `$` in a replacement string it must now be escaped with an additional `$`.
- `resourcedetectionprocessor`: Bump OpenShift semconv version from 1.16.0 to 1.18.0. (#19168)
  Rename google openshift platform attribute from google_cloud_openshift to gcp_openshift.
- `spanmetricsconnector`: Drop Prometheus-specific metrics labels sanitization. (#18678)
  The spanmeterics connector is the OTel component, therefore, we would
  like to strip Prometheus-specific parts from it. Metric names and attributes
  conversion to Prometheus conventions should happen in Prometheus components,
  e.g. Prometheus Remote Write exporter.
  

### 🚀 New components 🚀

  enables use of boolean attrbiutes in defining tail sampling policies
- `pkg/stanza`: Add `header_delimiter` option to the `csv_parser`. (#18198)
- `datadogexporter`: Enable gzip compression for metric payloads submitted by native Datadog client (#17373)
- `hostmetrics`: Have the hostmetrics receiver file system scraper use more debug messages (#18236)
  Log a debug message instead of an error if the collector does not have the permissions to access a locked drive on the host. We do not want to log an error message on every poll for this case.
- `exporter/prometheus`: Produce exemplars for monotonic sum metrics (i.e. counters in Prometheus) when available (#18201)
  This could be a breaking change if you already have enabled OpenMetrics format for the Prometheus exporter and have enabled exemplar ingestion in your Prometheus scraper.  To ensure names and types are generated correctly according to the OpenMetrics conventions, you should run your collector with `--feature-gates=pkg.translator.prometheus.NormalizeName`
- `filelogreceiver`: Adds ability to parse a file header and parse it as metadata to decorate log entries. (#18198)

- `k8sattributesprocessor`: k8sattributesprocessor e2e tests support metric data type. (#18391)
- `k8sattributesprocessor`: Default `container.id` to latest instance unless `k8s.container.restart_count` is specified (#16432)
- `mdatagen`: Turn on the ability to enable/disable resource attributes by embedding MetricsSettings and ResourceAttributesSettings into all scraping receivers as MetricsBuilderConfig (#16373)
  Currently, the only way to add configurative functionality to mdatagen is by using a bunch of WithResourceAttributesSettings options to the constructor.
  This PR changes the first argument to the NewMetricsBuilder constructor to be of type MetricsBuilderConfig,
  which is a new class that wraps both MetricsSettings and ResourceAttributesSettings, and may be (hopefully) easily extended with more
  configuration in the future.

  If the `_created` metric was present in the Histogram, Summary or Counter
  metric family, only then its values is used to set `StartTimeUnixNano` on the
  relevant OTLP metric and dropped afterwards. Otherwise, it is converted to the
  monotonic OTLP Sum metric.
  This behaviour is disabled by default. Use the `receiver.prometheusreceiver.UseCreatedMetric`
  to enable it.
  
- `exporter/prometheusremotewriteexporter`: Export exemplars for the Monotonic Sum metric. (#17573)
- `windowseventlogreceiver`: Fix panic that can occur when event is larger than current buffer size. (#17879)
- `windowseventlogreceiver`: Fixed a panic that could create an empty buffer due to incorrect use of unsafe pointers in syscall. (#17878)
  Fixed a potential panic due to a syscall indicating a that the event buffer should resize to 0. The next used of that resized buffer would result in an index out of bounds panic.
  
  Also, added a safety check for buffer resize cases that if the syscall indicates it needs the buffer size to be 0, an error will be returned.

- `tanzuobservabilityexporter`: Add a new metric exporter config(app_tags_excluded) to exclude application resource attrs(application, service.name, cluster, shard) from the metric tags. Rename the config resource_attributes to resource_attrs_included. Build in-house logic in the tanzuobservability exporter and remove the usage of resourcetotelemetry. (#14733)

### 🚩 Deprecations 🚩

- `hostmetricsreceiver`: Introduce renamed process memory metrics (#14327)
  This starts the process of phasing out incorrect metric names:

  - `process.memory.physical_usage`
  - `process.memory.virtual_usage`

  and replacing them with the names adhering to the semantic conventions:

  - `process.memory.usage`
  - `process.memory.virtual`

  At this stage, the new metrics are added, but they are disabled by default.
  See the "Deprecations" section of the Host Metrics receiver's README for details.

    value to fill in log metadata recognized upstream.

    This is a breaking change, and as such will generate a startup
    error if the exporter is configured to send to an endpoint that
    does not support this feature.
