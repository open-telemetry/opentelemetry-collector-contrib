## Overview

Generate metrics and logs from record [application exceptions](https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions/blob/main/docs/exceptions/exceptions-spans.md/) associated with spans.

Each **metric** and **log** will have _at least_ the following dimensions:
- Service name
- Span kind
- Status code

With the provided default config, each **metric** and **log** will also have the following dimensions:
- Exception message
- Exception type

Each log will additionally have the following attributes:
- Exception stacktrace
- HTTP attributes (if available), such as `http.method` and `http.url`.

## Configurations

If you are not already familiar with connectors, you may find it helpful to first visit the [Connectors README].

The following settings can be optionally configured:
- `dimensions`: the list of dimensions to add together with the default dimensions defined above.
  
  Each additional dimension is defined with a `name` which is looked up in the span's collection of attributes or resource attributes.

  The provided default config includes `exception.type` and `exception.message` as additional dimensions.

## Examples

The following is a simple example usage of the `exceptions` connector.

For configuration examples on other use cases, please refer to [More Examples](#more-examples).
