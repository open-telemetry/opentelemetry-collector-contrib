## Overview

Generate metrics and logs from record [application exceptions](https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions/blob/main/docs/exceptions/exceptions-spans.md/) associated with spans.

Each **metric** and **log** will have _at least_ the following dimensions:
- Service name
- Span kind
- Status code

With the provided default config, each **metric** and **log** will also have the following dimensions:
- Exception message
- Exception type

Each log will additionally have the following attributes:
- Exception stacktrace
- HTTP attributes from spans starting with `http.`.

## Configurations

If you are not already familiar with connectors, you may find it helpful to first visit the [Connectors README].

The following settings can be optionally configured:
- `dimensions`: the list of dimensions to add together with the default dimensions defined above.
  
  Each additional dimension is defined with a `name` which is looked up in the span's collection of attributes or resource attributes.

  The provided default config includes `exception.type` and `exception.message` as additional dimensions.

## Examples

The following is a simple example usage of the `exceptions` connector.

```yaml
receivers:
  nop:

exporters:
  nop:

connectors:
  exceptions:

service:
  pipelines:
    traces:
      receivers: [nop]
      exporters: [exceptions]
    metrics:
      receivers: [exceptions]
      exporters: [nop]
    logs:
      receivers: [exceptions]
      exporters: [nop]      
```

The following is a more complex example usage of the `exceptions` connector using Prometheus and Loki as exporters.

```yaml
receivers:
  otlp:
    protocols:
      grpc:
      http:

exporters:
  prometheusremotewrite:
    endpoint: http://prometheus:9090/api/v1/write
  loki:
    endpoint: http://loki:3100/loki/api/v1/push

connectors:
  exceptions:

service:
  pipelines:
    traces:
      receivers: [otlp]
      exporters: [exceptions]
    metrics:
      receivers: [exceptions]
      exporters: [prometheusremotewrite]
    logs:
      receivers: [exceptions]
      exporters: [loki]
```

The full list of settings exposed for this connector are documented [here](../../connector/exceptionsconnector/config.go).
