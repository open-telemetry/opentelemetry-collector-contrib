      ## @param span_name_remappings - map of key/value pairs - optional
      ## A map of Datadog span operation name keys and preferred name valuues to update those names to. This can be used to
      ## automatically map Datadog Span Operation Names to an updated value, and is useful when a user wants to
      ## shorten or modify span names to something more user friendly in the case of instrumentation libraries with

      ## @param span_name_as_resource_name - use OpenTelemetry semantic convention for span naming - optional
      ## Option created to maintain similarity with the OpenTelemetry semantic conventions as discussed in the issue below.
      ## https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/tree/main/specification/trace/semantic_conventions
      ## https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/issues/1909
      #
      span_name_as_resource_name: true
      ## @param compute_stats_by_span_kind - enables APM stats computation based on `span.kind` - optional
      ## If set to true, enables an additional stats computation check on spans to see they have an eligible `span.kind` (server, consumer, client, producer).
      ## If enabled, a span with an eligible `span.kind` will have stats computed. If disabled, only top-level and measured spans will have stats computed.
      ## NOTE: For stats computed from OTel traces, only top-level spans are considered when this option is off.
      #
      ## If you are sending OTel traces and want stats on non-top-level spans, this flag will need to be enabled.
      ## If you are sending OTel traces and do not want stats computed by span kind, you need to disable this flag and disable `compute_top_level_by_span_kind`.
      #
      compute_stats_by_span_kind: true
      ## @param compute_top_level_by_span_kind - enables top-level span identification based on `span.kind` - optional
      ## If set to true, root spans and spans with a server or consumer `span.kind` will be marked as top-level.
      ## Additionally, spans with a client or producer `span.kind` will have stats computed.
      ## Enabling this config option may increase the number of spans that generate trace metrics, and may change which spans appear as top-level in Datadog.
      #
      compute_top_level_by_span_kind: false
      ## @param peer_tags_aggregation - enables aggregation of peer related tags in Datadog exporter - optional
      ## If set to true, enables aggregation of peer related tags (e.g., `peer.service`, `db.instance`, etc.) in Datadog exporter.
      ## If disabled, aggregated trace stats will not include these tags as dimensions on trace metrics.
      ## For the best experience with peer tags, Datadog also recommends enabling `compute_stats_by_span_kind`.
      ## If you are using an OTel tracer, it's best to have both enabled because client/producer spans with relevant peer tags
      ## may not be marked by Datadog exporter as top-level spans.
      ## If enabling both causes Datadog exporter to consume too many resources, try disabling `compute_stats_by_span_kind` first.
      ## A high cardinality of peer tags or APM resources can also contribute to higher CPU and memory consumption.
      ## You can check for the cardinality of these fields by making trace search queries in the Datadog UI.
      ## The default list of peer tags can be found in https://github.com/DataDog/datadog-agent/blob/main/pkg/trace/stats/concentrator.go.

      peer_tags_aggregation: true
      ## @param trace_buffer - specifies the number of outgoing trace payloads to buffer before dropping - optional
      ## If unset, the default value is 1000.
      ## If you start seeing log messages like `Payload in channel full. Dropped 1 payload.` in the datadog exporter, consider
      ## setting a higher `trace_buffer` to avoid traces being dropped.
      #
      trace_buffer: 500
      ## @param peer_tags - [BETA] Optional list of supplementary peer tags that go beyond the defaults. The Datadog backend validates all tags
      ## and will drop ones that are unapproved. The default set of peer tags can be found at
      ## https://github.com/DataDog/datadog-agent/blob/505170c4ac8c3cbff1a61cf5f84b28d835c91058/pkg/trace/stats/concentrator.go#L55.

      resource_attributes_as_container_tags: ["could.availability_zone", "could.region"]
      ## @param bucket_interval specifies the time interval size of aggregation buckets that aggregate the Datadog trace metrics.
      ## It is also the time interval that Datadog trace metrics payloads are flushed to the pipeline.
      ## If you are concerned about the metric volume generated by the Datadog connector and the resulting networking egress, try increasing bucket_interval.
      ## Default is 10s if unset.
