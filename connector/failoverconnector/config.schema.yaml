    description: PipelinePriority is the list of pipeline level priorities in a 1 - n configuration, multiple pipelines can sit at a single priority level and will be routed in a fanout. If any pipeline at a level fails, the level is considered unhealthy

    description: RetryGap is how much time will pass between trying two separate priority levels in a single RetryInterval If the priority list has 3 levels, the RetryInterval is 5m, and the retryGap is 1m, within the 5m RetryInterval, the connector will only try one level every 1m, and will return to the stable level in the interim
