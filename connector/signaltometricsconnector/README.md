## Configuration

The component can produce metrics from spans, datapoints (for metrics), and logs.
At least one of the metrics for one signal type MUST be specified correctly for
the component to work.

All signal types can be configured to produce metrics with the same configuration
structure. For example, the below configuration will produce delta temporality counters
for counting number of events for each of the configured signals:

```yaml
signaltometrics:
  spans:
    - name: span.count
      description: Count of spans
      sum:
        value: Int(AdjustedCount()) # Count of total spans represented by each span
  datapoints:
    - name: datapoint.count
      description: Count of datapoints
      sum:
        value: "1" # increment by 1 for each datapoint
  logs:
    - name: logrecord.count
      description: Count of log records
      sum:
        value: "1" # increment by 1 for each log record
```

### Metrics types

`signaltometrics` produces a variety of metric types by utilizing [OTTL](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/pkg/ottl/README.md)
to extract the relevant data for a metric type from the incoming data. The
component can produce the following metric types for each signal types:

- [Sum](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/metrics/data-model/#sums)
- [Histogram](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/metrics/data-model/#histogram)
- [Exponential Histogram](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/metrics/data-model/#exponentialhistogram)

The component does NOT perform any stateful or time based aggregations. The metric
types are aggregated for the payload sent in each `Consume*` call. The final metric
is then sent forward in the pipeline.

#### Sum

Sum metrics have the following configurations:

```yaml
sum:
  value: <ottl_value_expression>
```

- [**Required**] `value` represents an OTTL expression to extract a value from the
  incoming data. Only OTTL expressions that return a value are accepted. The
  returned value determines the value type of the `sum` metric (`int` or `double`).
  [OTTL converters](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/pkg/ottl/ottlfuncs#readme-converters)
  can be used to transform the data.

#### Histogram

Histogram metrics have the following configurations:

```yaml
histogram:
  buckets: []float64
  count: <ottl_value_expression>
  value: <ottl_value_expression>
```

- [**Optional**] `buckets` represents the buckets to be used for the histogram.
  If no buckets are configured then it defaults to:

  ```go
  []float64{2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 50, 100, 200, 400, 800, 1000, 1400, 2000, 5000, 10_000, 15_000}
  ```

- [**Optional**] `count` represents an OTTL expression to extract the count to be
  recorded in the histogram from the incoming data. If no expression is provided
  then it defaults to the count of the signal. [OTTL converters](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/pkg/ottl/ottlfuncs#readme-converters)
  can be used to transform the data. For spans, a special converter [adjusted count](#custom-ottl-functions),
  is provided to help calculate the span's [adjusted count](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/trace/tracestate-probability-sampling-experimental/#adjusted-count).
- [**Required**] `value` represents an OTTL expression to extract the value to be
  recorded in the histogram from the incoming data. [OTTL converters](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/pkg/ottl/ottlfuncs#readme-converters)
  can be used to transform the data.

#### Exponential Histogram

Exponential histogram metrics have the following configurations:

```yaml
exponential_histogram:
  max_size: <int64>
  count: <ottl_value_expression>
  value: <ottl_value_expression>
```

- [**Optional**] `max_size` represents the maximum number of buckets per positive
  or negative number range. Defaults to `160`.
- [**Optional**] `count` represents an OTTL expression to extract the count to be
  recorded in the exponential histogram from the incoming data. If no expression
  is provided then it defaults to the count of the signal. [OTTL converters](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/pkg/ottl/ottlfuncs#readme-converters)
  can be used to transform the data. For spans, a special converter [adjusted count](#custom-ottl-functions),
  is provided to help calculate the span's [adjusted count](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/trace/tracestate-probability-sampling-experimental/#adjusted-count).
- [**Required**] `value` represents an OTTL expression to extract the value to be
  recorded in the exponential histogram from the incoming data. [OTTL converters](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/pkg/ottl/ottlfuncs#readme-converters)
  can be used to transform the data.

### Attributes

The component can produce metrics categorized by the attributes (span attributes
for traces, datapoint attributes for datapoints, or log record attributes for logs)
from the incoming data by configuring `attributes` for the configured metrics.

If no `attributes` are configured then the metrics are produced without any attributes.

```yaml
attributes:
  - key: datapoint.foo
  - key: datapoint.bar
    default_value: bar
```

If attributes are specified then a separate metric will be generated for each unique
set of attribute values. Optionally, a `default_value` can be used to always include
the attribute with the value of the attribute defaulting to the value specified in
`default_value` if the incoming data is missing that attribute.

### Conditions

Conditions are an optional list of OTTL conditions that are evaluated on the incoming
data and are ORed together. For example:

```yaml
signaltometrics:
  datapoints:
    - name: datapoint.bar.sum
      description: Count total number of datapoints as per datapoint.bar attribute
      conditions:
        - resource.attributes["foo"] != nil
        - resource.attributes["bar"] != nil
      sum:
        value: "1"
```

The above configuration will produce sum metrics from datapoints with either `foo`
OR `bar` resource attribute defined.

Conditions can also be ANDed together, for example:

```yaml
signaltometrics:
  datapoints:
    - name: gauge.to.exphistogram
      conditions:
        - metric.type == 1 AND resource.attributes["resource.foo"] != nil
      exponential_histogram:
        count: "1" # 1 count for each datapoint
        value: Double(value_int) + value_double # handle both int and double
```

The above configuration produces exponential histogram from gauge metrics with resource
attributes `resource.foo` set.

### Customizing resource attributes

The component allows customizing the resource attributes for the produced metrics
by specifying a list of attributes that should be included in the final metrics.
If no attributes are specified for `include_resource_attributes` then no filtering
is performed i.e. all resource attributes of the incoming data is considered.

```yaml
include_resource_attributes:
  - key: resource.foo # Include resource.foo attribute if present
  - key: resource.bar # Always include resource.bar attribute, default to bar
    default_value: bar
```

With the above configuration the produced metrics would only have the couple of
resource attributes specified in the list:

- `resource.foo` will be present for the produced metrics if the incoming data also
  has the attribute defined.
- `resource.bar` will always be present because of the `default_value`. If the incoming
  data does not have a resource attribute with name `resource.bar` then the configured
  `default_value` of `bar` will be used.

### Single writer

Metrics data streams MUST obey [single-writer](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/metrics/data-model/#single-writer)
principle. However, since `signaltometrics` component produces metrics from all signal
types and also allows customizing the resource attributes, there is a possibility
of violating the single-writer principle. To keep the single-writer principle intact,
the component adds collector instance information as resource attributes. The following
resource attributes are added to each produced metrics:

```yaml
signaltometrics.service.name: <service_name_of_the_otel_collector>
signaltometrics.service.namespace: <service_namespace_of_the_otel_collector>
signaltometrics.service.instance.id: <service_instance_id_of_the_otel_collector>
```

### Custom OTTL functions

The component implements the following custom OTTL functions:

1. `AdjustedCount`: a converter capable of calculating [adjusted count for a span](https://github.com/open-telemetry/oteps/blob/main/text/trace/0235-sampling-threshold-in-trace-state.md).
