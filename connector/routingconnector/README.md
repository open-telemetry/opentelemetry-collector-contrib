Routes logs, metrics or traces based on resource attributes to specific pipelines using [OpenTelemetry Transformation Language (OTTL)](../../pkg/ottl/README.md) statements as routing conditions.

## Configuration

If you are not already familiar with connectors, you may find it helpful to first visit the [Connectors README].

The following settings are available:

- `table (required)`: the routing table for this connector.
- `table.context (optional, default: resource)`: the [OTTL Context] in which the statement will be evaluated. Currently, only `resource`, `log`, and `request` are supported.
- `table.statement`: the routing condition provided as the [OTTL] statement. Required if `table.condition` is not provided. May not be used for `request` context.
- `table.condition`: the routing condition provided as the [OTTL] condition. Required if `table.statement` is not provided. Required for `request` context.
- `table.pipelines (required)`: the list of pipelines to use when the routing condition is met.
- `default_pipelines (optional)`: contains the list of pipelines to use when a record does not meet any of specified conditions.
- `error_mode (optional)`: determines how errors returned from OTTL statements are handled. Valid values are `propagate`, `ignore` and `silent`. If `ignore` or `silent` is used and a statement's condition has an error then the payload will be routed to the default pipelines. When `silent` is used the error is not logged. If not supplied, `propagate` is used.
- `match_once (optional, default: false)`: determines whether the connector matches multiple statements or not. If enabled, the payload will be routed to the first pipeline in the `table` whose routing condition is met. May only be `false` when used with `resource` context.

### Limitations

- The `match_once` setting is only supported when using the `resource` context. If any routes use `log` or `request` context, `match_once` must be set to `true`.
- The `request` context requires use of the `condition` setting, and relies on a very limited grammar. Conditions must be in the form of `request["key"] == "value"` or `request["key"] != "value"`. (In the future, this grammar may be expanded to support more complex conditions.)

### Supported [OTTL] functions

- [IsMatch](../../pkg/ottl/ottlfuncs/README.md#IsMatch)
- [delete_key](../../pkg/ottl/ottlfuncs/README.md#delete_key)
- [delete_matching_keys](../../pkg/ottl/ottlfuncs/README.md#delete_matching_keys)

## Additional Settings

The full list of settings exposed for this connector are documented [here](./config.go) with detailed sample configuration files:

- [logs](./testdata/config/logs.yaml)
- [metrics](./testdata/config/metrics.yaml)
- [traces](./testdata/config/traces.yaml)

## Examples

Route traces based on an attribute:

```yaml
receivers:
    otlp:

exporters:
  jaeger:
    endpoint: localhost:14250
  jaeger/acme:
    endpoint: localhost:24250
  jaeger/ecorp:
    endpoint: localhost:34250

connectors:
  routing:
    default_pipelines: [traces/jaeger]
    error_mode: ignore
    match_once: false
    table:
      - statement: route() where attributes["X-Tenant"] == "acme"
        pipelines: [traces/jaeger-acme]
      - statement: delete_key(attributes, "X-Tenant") where IsMatch(attributes["X-Tenant"], ".*corp")
        pipelines: [traces/jaeger-ecorp]

  routing/match_once:
    default_pipelines: [traces/jaeger]
    error_mode: ignore
    match_once: true
    table:
      - statement: route() where attributes["X-Tenant"] == "acme"
        pipelines: [traces/jaeger-acme]
      - statement: route() where attributes["X-Tenant"] == ".*acme"
        pipelines: [traces/jaeger-ecorp]

service:
  pipelines:
    traces/in:
      receivers: [otlp]
      exporters: [routing]
    traces/jaeger:
      receivers: [routing]
      exporters: [jaeger]

    traces/jaeger-ecorp:
      receivers: [routing]
      exporters: [jaeger/ecorp]
```

Route logs based on tenant:

```yaml
receivers:
    otlp:

exporters:
  file/other:
    path: ./other.log
  file/acme:
    path: ./acme.log
  file/ecorp:
    path: ./ecorp.log

connectors:
  routing:
    match_once: true
    default_pipelines: [logs/other]
    table:
      - context: request
        condition: reqeust["X-Tenant"] == "acme"
        pipelines: [logs/acme]
      - context: request
        condition: reqeust["X-Tenant"] == "ecorp"
        pipelines: [logs/ecorp]

service:
  pipelines:
    logs/in:
      receivers: [otlp]

    logs/ecorp:
      receivers: [routing]
      exporters: [file/ecorp]
    logs/other:
      receivers: [routing]
      exporters: [file/other]
```

Route logs based on region:

```yaml
receivers:
    otlp:

exporters:
  file/other:
    path: ./other.log
  file/east:
    path: ./east.log
  file/west:
    path: ./west.log

connectors:
  routing:
    match_once: true
    default_pipelines: [logs/other]
    table:
      - context: log
        condition: attributes["region"] == "east"
        pipelines: [logs/east]
      - context: log
        condition: attributes["region"] == "west"
        pipelines: [logs/west]

## Differences between the Routing Connector and Routing Processor

- Routing on context values is only supported for logs at this time.
- The connector routes to pipelines, not exporters as the processor does.
