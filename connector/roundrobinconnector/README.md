The `roundrobin` connector can fork pipelines of the same type and equally split the load between them.

## Configuration

If you are not already familiar with connectors, you may find it helpful to first visit the [Connectors README].

The `roundrobin` connector does not have any configuration settings.

```yaml
receivers:
  otlp:
exporters:
  prometheusremotewrite/1:
  prometheusremotewrite/2:
connectors:
  roundrobin:
```

Preprocess data, then export using multiple exporter instances to scale the throughput if the exporter 
does not support scale well (e.g. prometheusremotewrite).

```yaml
receivers:
  otlp:
processors:
  resourcedetection:
  batch:
exporters:
  prometheusremotewrite/1:
  prometheusremotewrite/2:
connectors:
  roundrobin:
service:
  pipelines:
    metrics:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [resourcedetection, batch]
      exporters: [roundrobin]
    metrics/1:
      receivers: [roundrobin]
      exporters: [prometheusremotewrite/1]
    metrics/2:
      receivers: [roundrobin]
      exporters: [prometheusremotewrite/2]
```
