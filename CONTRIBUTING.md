# Contributing

If you would like to contribute please read OpenTelemetry Collector [contributing
guidelines](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) before you begin your
work.

## Pull-requests

### Title guidelines

The title for your pull-request should contain the component type and name in brackets, plus a short statement for your
change. For instance:

    [processor/tailsampling] fix AND policy

### Description guidelines

When linking to an open issue, if your PR is meant to close said issue, please prefix your issue with one of the
following keywords: `Resolves`, `Fixes`, or `Closes`. More information on this functionality (and more keyword options) can be found
[here](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue#linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue-using-a-keyword).
This will automatically close the issue once your PR has been merged.

## Changelog

### Overview

There are two Changelogs for this repository:

- `CHANGELOG.md` is intended for users of the collector and lists changes that affect the behavior of the collector.
- `CHANGELOG-API.md` is intended for developers who are importing packages from the collector codebase.

### When to add a Changelog Entry

Pull requests that contain user-facing changes will require a changelog entry. Keep in mind the following types of users:
1. Those who are consuming the telemetry exported from the collector
2. Those who are deploying or otherwise managing the collector or its configuration
3. Those who are depending on APIs exported from collector packages
4. Those who are contributing to the repository

Changes that affect the first two groups should be noted in `CHANGELOG.md`. Changes that affect the third or forth groups should be noted in `CHANGELOG-API.md`.

If a changelog entry is not required, a maintainer or approver will add the `Skip Changelog` label to the pull request.

**Examples**

Changelog entry required:
- Changes to the configuration of the collector or any component
- Changes to the telemetry emitted from and/or processed by the collector
- Changes to the prerequisites or assumptions for running a collector
- Changes to an API exported by a collector package
- Meaningful changes to the performance of the collector

Judgement call:
- Major changes to documentation
- Major changes to tests or test frameworks
- Changes to developer tooling in the repo

No changelog entry:
- Typical documentation updates
- Refactorings with no meaningful change in functionality
- Most changes to tests
- Chores, such as enabling linters, or minor changes to the CI process

### Adding a Changelog Entry

The [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) and [CHANGELOG-API.md](./CHANGELOG-API.md) files in this repo is autogenerated from `.yaml` files in the `./.chloggen` directory.

Your pull-request should add a new `.yaml` file to this directory. The name of your file must be unique since the last release.

During the collector release process, all `./chloggen/*.yaml` files are transcribed into `CHANGELOG.md` and `CHANGELOG-API.md` and then deleted.

**Recommended Steps**
1. Create an entry file using `make chlog-new`. This generates a file based on your current branch (e.g. `./.chloggen/my-branch.yaml`)
2. Fill in all fields in the new file
3. Run `make chlog-validate` to ensure the new file is valid
4. Commit and push the file

Alternately, copy `./.chloggen/TEMPLATE.yaml`, or just create your file from scratch.

## Portable Code

In order to ensure compatibility with different operating systems, code should be portable. Below are some guidelines to follow when writing portable code:

* Avoid using platform-specific libraries, features etc. Please opt for portable multi-platform solutions. 

* Avoid hard-coding platform-specific values. Use environment variables or configuration files for storing platform-specific values.

    For example, avoid using hard-coded file path
    ```
    filePath := "C:\Users\Bob\Documents\sampleData.csv"
    ```

    Instead environment variable or configuration file can be used.
    ```
    filePath := os.Getenv("DATA_FILE_PATH")
    ```
    or
    ```
    filePath := Configuration.Get("data_file_path")
    ```

* Be mindful of 
  - Standard file systems and file paths such as forward slashes (/) instead of backward slashes (\\) in Windows. Use the [`path/filepath` package](https://pkg.go.dev/path/filepath) when working with filepaths. 
  - Consistent line ending formats such as Unix (LF) or Windows (CRLF).

* Test your implementation thoroughly on different platforms if possible and fix any issues. 

With above guidelines, you can write code that is more portable and easier to maintain across different platforms. 

## Adding New Components

**Before** any code is written, [open an
issue](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/issues/new?assignees=&labels=Sponsor+Needed%2Cneeds+triage&projects=&template=new_component.yaml&title=New+component%3A+)
providing the following information:

* Who's the sponsor for your component. A sponsor is an approver or maintainer who will be the official reviewer of the code and a code owner
  for the component. You will need to find a sponsor for the component in order for it to be accepted.
* Some information about your component, such as the reasoning behind it, use-cases, telemetry data types supported, and
  anything else you think is relevant for us to make a decision about accepting the component.
* The configuration options your component will accept. This will give us a better understanding of what it does, and 
  how it may be implemented.

Components refer to connectors, exporters, extensions, processors, and receivers. The key criteria to implementing a component is to:

* Implement the [component.Component](https://pkg.go.dev/go.opentelemetry.io/collector/component#Component) interface
* Provide a configuration structure which defines the configuration of the component
* Provide the implementation which performs the component operation
* Have a `metadata.yaml` file and its generated code (using [mdatadgen](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/main/cmd/mdatagen/README.md)).

Familiarize yourself with the interface of the component that you want to write, and use existing implementations as a reference.
[Building a Trace Receiver](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/trace-receiver/) tutorial provides a detailed example of building a component.

*NOTICE:* The Collector is in Beta stage and as such the interfaces may undergo breaking changes. Component creators
must be available to update or review their components when such changes happen, otherwise the component will be
excluded from the default builds.

Generally, maintenance of components is the responsibility of contributors who authored them. If the original author or
some other contributor does not maintain the component it may be excluded from the default build. The component **will**
be excluded if it causes build problems, has failing tests, or otherwise causes problems to the rest of the repository
and its contributors.

- Create your component under the proper folder and use Go standard package naming recommendations.
- Use a boiler-plate Makefile that just references the one at top level, ie.: `include ../../Makefile.Common` - this
  allows you to build your component with required build configurations for the contrib repo while avoiding building the
  full repo during development.
- Each component has its own go.mod file. This allows custom builds of the collector to take a limited sets of
  dependencies - so run `go mod` commands as appropriate for your component.
- Implement the needed interface on your component by importing the appropriate component from the core repo. Follow the
  pattern of existing components regarding config and factory source files and tests.
- Implement your component as appropriate. Provide end-to-end tests (or mock backend/client as appropriate). Target is
  to get 80% or more of code coverage.
- Add a README.md on the root of your component describing its configuration and usage, likely referencing some of the
  yaml files used in the component tests. We also suggest that the yaml files used in tests have comments for all
  available configuration settings so users can copy and modify them as needed.
- Run `make crosslink` to update intra-repository dependencies. It will add a `replace` directive to `go.mod` file of every intra-repository dependant. This is necessary for your component to be included in the contrib executable.
- Add your component to `versions.yaml`.
- All components included in the distribution must be included in
  [`cmd/otelcontribcol/builder-config.yaml`](./cmd/otelcontribcol/builder-config.yaml)
  and in the respective testing harnesses. To align with the test goal of the
  project, components must be testable within the framework defined within the
  folder. If a component can not be properly tested within the existing
  framework, it must increase the non testable components number with a comment
  within the PR explaining as to why it can not be tested. **(Note: this does
  not automatically include any components in official release binaries. See
  [Releasing new components](#releasing-new-components).)**

- Create a `metadata.yaml` file with at minimum the required fields defined in [metadata-schema.yaml](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/main/cmd/mdatagen/metadata-schema.yaml).
Here is a minimal representation:
```
type: <name of your component, such as apache, http, haproxy, postgresql>

status:
  class: <class of component, one of cmd, connector, exporter, extension, processor or receiver>
  stability:
    development: [<pick the signals supported: logs, metrics, traces. For extension, use "extension">]
  codeowners:
    active: [<github account of the sponsor, such as alice>, <your GitHub account if you are already an OpenTelemetry member>]
```
- Run `make generate-gh-issue-templates` to add your component to the dropdown list in the issue templates.
- For README.md, you can start with the following:
```
# <Title of your component>
<!-- status autogenerated section -->
<!-- end autogenerated section -->
```
- Create a `doc.go` file with a generate pragma. For a `fooreceiver`, the file will look like:
```
// Copyright The OpenTelemetry Authors
// SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0

//go:generate mdatagen metadata.yaml

// Package fooreceiver bars.
package fooreceiver // import "github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/receiver/fooreceiver"
```
- Type `make update-codeowners`. This will trigger the regeneration of the `.github/CODEOWNERS` file and the [metadata generator](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/main/cmd/mdatagen/README.md#using-the-metadata-generator) to generate the associated code/documentation.

When submitting a component to the community, consider breaking it down into separate PRs as follows:

* **First PR** should include the overall structure of the new component:
  * Readme, configuration, and factory implementation usually using the helper
    factory structs.
  * This PR is usually trivial to review, so the size limit does not apply to
    it.
  * The component should use [`In Development` Stability](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector#development) in its README.
  * Before submitting a PR, run the following commands from the root of the repository to ensure your new component is meeting the repo linting expectations:
    * `make checkdoc`
    * `make checkmetadata`
    * `make checkapi`
    * `make goporto`
    * `make crosslink`
    * `make gotidy`
    * `make genotelcontribcol`
    * `make genoteltestbedcol`
    * `make generate`
    * `make multimod-verify`
    * `make generate-gh-issue-templates`
    * `make gengithub`
    * `make addlicense`
* **Second PR** should include the concrete implementation of the component. If the
  size of this PR is larger than the recommended size consider splitting it in
  multiple PRs.
* **Last PR** should mark the new component as `Alpha` stability.
  * Update its `metadata.yaml` file.
    * Mark the stability as `alpha`
    * Add `contrib` to the list of distributions
  * Add it to the `cmd/otelcontribcol` binary by updating the `cmd/otelcontribcol/builder-config.yaml` file.
  * Please also run:
    - `make generate`
    - `make genotelcontribcol`
 
  * The component must be enabled only after sufficient testing and only when it meets [`Alpha` stability requirements](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/main/docs/component-stability.md#alpha).
* Once your component has reached `Alpha` stability, you may also submit a PR to the [OpenTelemetry Collector Releases](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-releases) repository to include your component in future releases of the OpenTelemetry Collector `contrib` distribution.
* Once a new component has been added to the executable:
  * Please add the component
    to the [OpenTelemetry.io registry](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry.io#adding-a-project-to-the-opentelemetry-registry).

### Releasing New Components
After a component has been merged it must be added to the
[OpenTelemetry Collector Contrib's release manifest.yaml](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-releases/blob/main/distributions/otelcol-contrib/manifest.yaml)
to be included in the distributed otelcol-contrib binaries and docker images.

## Adding metrics to existing receivers
Following these steps for contributing additional metrics to existing receivers.
 - Read instructions [here](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#fork) on how to
   fork, build and create PRs. The only difference is to change repository name from `opentelemetry-collector` to `opentelemetry-collector-contrib`
 - Edit `metadata.yaml` of your metrics receiver to add new metrics, e.g.: `redisreceiver/metadata.yaml`
 - To generate new metrics on top of this updated YAML file.
   - Run `cd receiver/redisreceiver`
   - Run `go generate ./...`
- Review the changed files and merge the changes into your forked repo.
- Create PR from Github web console following the instructions above.

## General Recommendations
Below are some recommendations that apply to typical components. These are not rigid rules and there are exceptions but
in general try to follow them.

- Avoid introducing batching, retries or worker pools directly on receivers and exporters. Typically, these are general
  cases that can be better handled via processors (that also can be reused by other receivers and exporters).
- When implementing exporters try to leverage the exporter helpers from the core repo, see [exporterhelper
  package](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/tree/main/exporter/exporterhelper). This will
  ensure that the exporter provides [zPages](https://opencensus.io/zpages/) and a standard set of metrics.
- `replace` statements in `go.mod` files can be automatically inserted by running `make crosslink`. For more information
  on the `crosslink` tool see the README [here](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go-build-tools/tree/main/crosslink).

## Issue Triaging

See [issue-triaging.md](./issue-triaging.md) for more information on the issue triaging process.

### Adding Labels via Comments

In order to facilitate proper label usage and to empower Code Owners, you are able to add labels to issues via comments. To add a label through a comment, post a new comment on an issue starting with `/label`, followed by a space-separated list of your desired labels. Supported labels come from the table below, or correspond to a component defined in the [CODEOWNERS file](.github/CODEOWNERS).

The following general labels are supported:

| Label                     | Label in Comment          |
|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| `arm64`                   | `arm64`                   |
| `good first issue`        | `good-first-issue`        |
| `help wanted`             | `help-wanted`             |
| `discussion needed`       | `discussion-needed`       |
| `needs triage`            | `needs-triage`            |
| `os:mac`                  | `os:mac`                  |
| `os:windows`              | `os:windows`              |
| `waiting for author`      | `waiting-for-author`      |
| `waiting-for-code-owners` | `waiting-for-code-owners` |
| `bug`                     | `bug`                     |
| `priority:p0`             | `priority:p0`             |
| `priority:p1`             | `priority:p1`             |
| `priority:p2`             | `priority:p2`             |
| `priority:p3`             | `priority:p3`             |
| `Stale`                   | `stale`                   |
| `never stale`             | `never-stale`             |

To delete a label, prepend the label with `-`. Note that you must make a new comment to modify labels; you cannot edit an existing comment.

Example label comment:

```
/label receiver/prometheus help-wanted -exporter/prometheus
```

## Membership, Roles, and Responsibilities

### Membership levels

See the [OpenTelemetry membership guide](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community/blob/main/guides/contributor/membership.md) for information on how to become a member of the OpenTelemetry organization and the different roles available. In addition to the roles listed there we also have a Collector-specific role: code owners.

### Becoming a Code Owner

A Code Owner is responsible for a component within Collector Contrib, as indicated by the [CODEOWNERS file](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/.github/CODEOWNERS). That responsibility includes maintaining the component, triaging and responding to issues, and reviewing pull requests.

Sometimes a component may be in need of a new or additional Code Owner. A few reasons this situation may arise would be:

- The existing Code Owners are actively looking for more help.
- A previous Code Owner stepped down.
- An existing Code Owner has become unresponsive. See [unmaintained stability status](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector#unmaintained).
- The component was never assigned a Code Owner.

Code Ownership does not have to be a full-time job. If you can find a couple hours to help out on a recurring basis, please consider pursuing Code Ownership.

#### Requirements

If you would like to help and become a Code Owner you must meet the following requirements:

1. [Be a member of the OpenTelemetry organization.](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community/blob/main/guides/contributor/membership.md#member)
2. (Code Owner Discretion) It is best to have resolved an issue related to the component, contributed directly to the component, and/or review component PRs. How much interaction with the component is required before becoming a Code Owner is up to any existing Code Owners.

Code Ownership is ultimately up to the judgement of the existing Code Owners and Collector Contrib Maintainers. Meeting the above requirements is not a guarantee to be granted Code Ownership.

#### How to become a Code Owner

To become a Code Owner, open a PR with the following changes:

1. Add your GitHub username to the active codeowners entry in the component's `metadata.yaml` file.
2. Run the command `make update-codeowners`.
      * Note: A GitHub [personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens) must be configured for this command to work.
      * If this command is unsuccessful, manually update the component's row in the [CODEOWNERS](.github/CODEOWNERS) file, and then run `make generate` to regenerate the component's README header.

Be sure to tag the existing Code Owners, if any, within the PR to ensure they receive a notification.

### Emeritus roles

Contributors who are unable to meet the responsibilities of their role are encouraged to move to [emeritus](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community/blob/main/guides/contributor/membership.md#emeritus-maintainerapprovertriager). In case of long temporary absences, contributors are encouraged to let maintainers know on the CNCF Slack (e.g. on the #otel-collector-dev channel or privately via DM) and to mark themselves as 'Busy' on Github.

In the event that a contributor becomes inactive without prior notice, the maintainers will attempt to contact the contributor via both Github and the CNCF Slack to confirm their status. After two weeks, if the contributor is an approver or maintainer, they may be removed from the Github review auto-assignment.

If the contributor does not respond within a period of two months, they may be moved to emeritus status at the discretion of the maintainers, following a majority vote among the maintainers (possibly excluding the contributor in question).

## Makefile Guidelines

When adding or modifying the `Makefile`'s in this repository, consider the following design guidelines.

Make targets are organized according to whether they apply to the entire repository, or only to an individual module.
The [Makefile](./Makefile) SHOULD contain "repo-level" targets. (i.e. targets that apply to the entire repo.)
Likewise, `Makefile.Common` SHOULD contain "module-level" targets. (i.e. targets that apply to one module at a time.)
Each module should have a `Makefile` at its root that includes `Makefile.Common`.

### Module-level targets

Module-level targets SHOULD NOT act on nested modules. For example, running `make lint` at the root of the repo will
*only* evaluate code that is part of the `go.opentelemetry.io/collector` module. This excludes nested modules such as
`go.opentelemetry.io/collector/component`.

Each module-level target SHOULD have a corresponding repo-level target. For example, `make golint` will run `make lint`
in each module. In this way, the entire repository is covered. The root `Makefile` contains some "for each module" targets
that can wrap a module-level target into a repo-level target.

### Repo-level targets

Whenever reasonable, targets SHOULD be implemented as module-level targets (and wrapped with a repo-level target).
However, there are many valid justifications for implementing a standalone repo-level target.

1. The target naturally applies to the repo as a whole. (e.g. Building the collector.)
2. Interaction between modules would be problematic.
3. A necessary tool does not provide a mechanism for scoping its application. (e.g. `porto` cannot be limited to a specific module.)
4. The "for each module" pattern would result in incomplete coverage of the codebase. (e.g. A target that scans all file, not just `.go` files.)

### Default targets

The default module-level target (i.e. running `make` in the context of an individual module), should run a substantial set of module-level
targets for an individual module. Ideally, this would include *all* module-level targets, but exceptions should be made if a particular
target would result in unacceptable latency in the local development loop.

The default repo-level target (i.e. running `make` at the root of the repo) should meaningfully validate the entire repo. This should include
running the default common target for each module as well as additional repo-level targets.
