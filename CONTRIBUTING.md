# Contributing

If you would like to contribute please read OpenTelemetry Collector [contributing
guidelines](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) before you begin your
work.

## Pull-request title

The title for your pull-request should contain the component type and name in brackets, plus a short statement for your
change. For instance:

    [processor/tailsampling] fix AND policy

## Changelog

Pull requests that contain user-facing changes will require a changelog entry. Keep in mind the following types of users:
1. Those who are consuming the telemetry exported from the collector
2. Those who are deploying or otherwise managing the collector or its configuration
3. Those who are depending on APIs exported from collector packages
4. Those who are contributing to the repository

The changelog is primarily directed at the first three groups but it is sometimes appropriate to include important updates relevant only to the forth group.

If a changelog entry is not required, a maintainer or approver will add the `Skip Changelog` label to the pull request.

**Examples**

Changelog entry required:
- Changes to the configuration of the collector or any component
- Changes to the telemetry emitted from and/or processed by the collector
- Changes to the prerequisites or assumptions for running a collector
- Changes to an API exported by a collector package
- Meaningful changes to the performance of the collector

Judgement call:
- Major changes to documentation
- Major changes to tests or test frameworks
- Changes to developer tooling in the repo

No changelog entry:
- Typical documentation updates
- Refactorings with no meaningful change in functionality
- Most changes to tests
- Chores, such as enabling linters, or minor changes to the CI process

### Adding a Changelog Entry

The [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) file in this repo is autogenerated from `.yaml` files in the `./unreleased` directory.

Your pull-request should add a new `.yaml` file to this directory. The name of your file must be unique since the last release.

During the collector release process, all `./unreleased/*.yaml` files are transcribed into `CHANGELOG.md` and then deleted.

**Recommended Steps**
1. Create an entry file using `make chlog-new`. This generates a file based on your current branch (e.g. `./unreleased/my-branch.yaml`)
2. Fill in all fields in the new file
3. Run `make chlog-validate` to ensure the new file is valid
4. Commit and push the file

Alternately, copy `./unreleased/TEMPLATE.yaml`, or just create your file from scratch.

## Adding New Components

**Before** any code is written, [open an
issue](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/issues/new?assignees=&labels=new+component&template=new_component.md&title=New%20component)
providing the following information:

* Who's the sponsor for your component. A sponsor is an approver who will be in charge of being the official reviewer of
  the code and become a code owner for the component. For vendor-specific components, it's good to have a volunteer
  sponsor. If you can't find one, we'll assign one in a round-robin fashion. A vendor-specific component directly interfaces
  with a vendor-specific API and is expected to be maintained by a representative of the same vendor. For non-vendor specific
  components, having a sponsor means that your use case has been validated.
* Some information about your component, such as the reasoning behind it, use-cases, telemetry data types supported, and
  anything else you think is relevant for us to make a decision about accepting the component.
* The configuration options your component will accept. This will help us understand what it does and have an idea of
  how the implementation might look like.


Any component (receiver, processor, exporter, or extension) needs to implement the interfaces defined on the [core
repository](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector). Familiarize yourself with the interface of the
component that you want to write, and use existing implementations as reference.

*NOTICE:* The Collector is in Beta stage and as such the interfaces may undergo breaking changes. Component creators
must be available to update or review their components when such changes happen, otherwise the component will be
excluded from the default builds.

Generally, maintenance of components is the responsibility of contributors who authored them. If the original author or
some other contributor does not maintain the component it may be excluded from the default build. The component **will**
be excluded if it causes build problems, has failing tests or otherwise causes problems to the rest of the repository
and the rest of contributors.

- Create your component under the proper folder and use Go standard package naming recommendations.
- Use a boiler-plate Makefile that just references the one at top level, ie.: `include ../../Makefile.Common` - this
  allows you to build your component with required build configurations for the contrib repo while avoiding building the
  full repo during development.
- Each component has its own go.mod file. This allows custom builds of the collector to take a limited sets of
  dependencies - so run `go mod` commands as appropriate for your component.
- Implement the needed interface on your component by importing the appropriate component from the core repo. Follow the
  pattern of existing components regarding config and factory source files and tests.
- Implement your component as appropriate. Provide end-to-end tests (or mock backend/client as appropriate). Target is
  to get 80% or more of code coverage.
- Add a README.md on the root of your component describing its configuration and usage, likely referencing some of the
  yaml files used in the component tests. We also suggest that the yaml files used in tests have comments for all
  available configuration settings so users can copy and modify them as needed.
- Add a `replace` directive at the root `go.mod` file so your component is included in the build of the contrib
  executable.
- Add your component to `versions.yaml`.
- All components must be included in [`internal/components/`](./internal/components) and in the respective testing
  harnesses. To align with the test goal of the project, components must be testable within the framework defined within
  the folder. If a component can not be properly tested within the existing framework, it must increase the non testable
  components number with a comment within the PR explaining as to why it can not be tested.

### Rotating sponsors

The following GitHub users are the currently available sponsors, either by being an approver or a maintainer of the contrib repository. The list is ordered based on a random sort of the list of sponsors done live at the Collector SIG meeting on 27-Apr-2022 and serves as the seed for the round-robin selection of sponsors, as described in the section above.

* [@Aneurysm9](https://github.com/Aneurysm9)
* [@mx-psi](https://github.com/mx-psi)
* [@pmm-sumo](https://github.com/pmm-sumo)
* [@jpkrohling](https://github.com/jpkrohling)
* [@dmitryax](https://github.com/dmitryax)
* [@bogdandrutu](https://github.com/bogdandrutu)
* [@dashpole](https://github.com/dashpole)
* [@TylerHelmuth](https://github.com/TylerHelmuth)
* [@djaglowski](https://github.com/djaglowski)
* [@codeboten](https://github.com/codeboten)

Whenever a sponsor is picked from the top of this list, please move them to the bottom.

## Adding metrics to existing receivers
Following these steps for contributing additional metrics to existing receivers.
 - Read instructions [here](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#fork) on how to
   fork, build and create PRs. The only difference is to change repository name from `opentelemetry-collector` to `opentelemetry-collector-contrib`
 - Edit `metadata.yaml` of your metrics receiver to add new metrics, e.g.: `redisreceiver/metadata.yaml`
 - To generate new metrics on top of this updated YAML file.
   - Run `cd receiver/redisreceiver`
   - Run `go generate ./...`
- Review the changed files and merge the changes into your forked repo.
- Create PR from Github web console following the instructions above.

## General Recommendations
Below are some recommendations that apply to typical components. These are not rigid rules and there are exceptions but
in general try to follow them.

- Avoid introducing batching, retries or worker pools directly on receivers and exporters. Typically, these are general
  cases that can be better handled via processors (that also can be reused by other receivers and exporters).
- When implementing exporters try to leverage the exporter helpers from the core repo, see [exporterhelper
  package](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/tree/main/exporter/exporterhelper). This will
  ensure that the exporter provides [zPages](https://opencensus.io/zpages/) and a standard set of metrics.
- `replace` statements in `go.mod` files can be automatically inserted by running `make crosslink`. For more information
  on the `crosslink` tool see the README [here](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go-build-tools/tree/main/crosslink).

## Becoming a Code Owner

A Code Owner is responsible for a component within Collector Contrib, as indicated by the [CODEOWNERS file](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/.github/CODEOWNERS). That responsibility includes maintaining the component, responding to issues, and reviewing pull requests.

Sometimes a component may be in need of a new or additional Code Owner. A few reasons this situation may arise would be:
- The component was never assigned a Code Owner.
- A previous Code Owner stepped down.
- An existing Code Owner has become unresponsive. See [unmaintained stability status](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector#unmaintained).
- The existing Code Owners are actively looking for new Code Owners to help.

If you would like to help and become a Code Owner you must meet the following requirements:

1. [Be a member of the OpenTelemetry organization.](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community/blob/main/community-membership.md#member)
2. (Code Owner Discretion) It is best to have resolved an issue related to the component, contributed directly to the component, and/or review component PRs. How much interaction with the component is required before becoming a Code Owner is up to any existing Code Owners. 

Code Ownership is ultimately up to the judgement of the existing Code Owners and Collector Contrib Maintainers. Meeting the above requirements is not a guarantee to be granted Code Ownership.

To become a Code Owner, open a PR with the CODEOWNERS file modified, adding your GitHub username to the component's row. Be sure to tag the existing Code Owners, if any, within the PR to ensure they receive a notification.
