# Profile Sample Context

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation applies only to version `0.132.0` and later. Information on earlier versions is not available.

The Profile Sample Context is a Context implementation for [pdata Profiles](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/tree/main/pdata/pprofile), the collector's internal representation for OTLP profile data. This Context should be used when interacted with OTLP profiles.

## Paths
In general, the Profile Sample Context supports accessing pdata using the field names from the [profiles proto](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-proto/blob/main/opentelemetry/proto/profiles/v1development/profiles.proto).  All integers are returned and set via `int64`. All doubles are returned and set via `float64`.

The following paths are supported.

| path                                   | field accessed                                                                                                                                            | type                                                                    |
