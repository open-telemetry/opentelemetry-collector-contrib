  ## The memory_limiter processor is used to prevent out of memory situations on the collector.
  memory_limiter:
    ## check_interval is the time between measurements of memory usage for the
    ## purposes of avoiding going over the limits. Defaults to zero, so no
    ## checks will be performed. Values below 1 second are not recommended since
    ## it can result in unnecessary CPU consumption.
    check_interval: 5s

    ## Maximum amount of memory, in MiB, targeted to be allocated by the process heap.
