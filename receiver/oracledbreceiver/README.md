This receiver collects metrics from an Oracle Database.

The receiver connects to a database host and performs periodically queries.

## Getting Started

To use the OracleDB receiver you must define how to connect to your DB. This can be done in two ways,
defined in the [Primary](#primary-configuration-option) and [Secondary](#secondary-configuration-option) configuration
option sections. Defining one of the two configurations is required. If both are defined, the primary
option will be used.

### Primary Configuration Option

Required options:
- `datasource`: Oracle database connection string. Special characters must be encoded. Refer to Oracle Go Driver go_ora documentation for full connection string options.

Example:

```yaml
receivers:
  oracledb:
    datasource: "oracle://otel:password@localhost:51521/XE"
```

### Secondary Configuration Option

Required options:
- `endpoint`: Endpoint used to connect to the OracleDB server. Must be in the format of `host:port`
- `password`: Password for the OracleDB connection. Special characters are allowed.
- `service`: OracleDB Service that the receiver should connect to.
- `username`: Username for the OracleDB connection.

Example:
```yaml
receivers:
  oracledb:
    endpoint: localhost:51521
    password: p@sswo%d
    service: XE
    username: otel
```

## Permissions

Depending on which metrics you collect, you will need to assign those permissions to the database user:
```
GRANT SELECT ON V_$SESSION TO <username>;
GRANT SELECT ON V_$SYSSTAT TO <username>;
GRANT SELECT ON V_$RESOURCE_LIMIT TO <username>;
GRANT SELECT ON DBA_TABLESPACES TO <username>;
GRANT SELECT ON DBA_DATA_FILES TO <username>;
```

## Enabling metrics.

See [documentation](./documentation.md).

You can enable or disable selective metrics.

Example:

```yaml
receivers:
  oracledb:
    datasource: "oracle://otel:password@localhost:51521/XE"
    metrics:
      oracledb.query.cpu_time:
        enabled: false
      oracledb.query.physical_read_requests:
        enabled: true
```
