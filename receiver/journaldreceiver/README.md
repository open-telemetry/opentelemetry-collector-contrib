Parses Journald events from systemd journal.
Journald receiver requires that:

- the `journalctl` binary is present in the $PATH of the agent; and
- the collector's user has sufficient permissions to access the journal through `journalctl`.

### Operators

Each operator performs a simple responsibility, such as parsing a timestamp or JSON. Chain together operators to process logs into a desired format.

- Every operator has a `type`.
- Every operator can be given a unique `id`. If you use the same type of operator more than once in a pipeline, you must specify an `id`. Otherwise, the `id` defaults to the value of `type`.
- Operators will output to the next operator in the pipeline. The last operator in the pipeline will emit from the receiver. Optionally, the `output` parameter can be used to specify the `id` of another operator to which logs will be passed directly.
- Only parsers and general purpose operators should be used.

### Example Configurations

```yaml
receivers:
  journald:
    directory: /run/log/journal
    units:
      - ssh
      - kubelet
      - docker
      - containerd
    priority: info
```

#### Matches

The following configuration:

```yaml
- type: journald_input
  matches:
    - _SYSTEMD_UNIT: ssh
    - _SYSTEMD_UNIT: kubelet
      _UID: "1000"
```

will be passed to `journalctl` as the following arguments: `journalctl ... _SYSTEMD_UNIT=ssh + _SYSTEMD_UNIT=kubelet _UID=1000`,
which is going to retrieve all entries which match at least one of the following rules:

- `_SYSTEMD_UNIT` is `ssh`
- `_SYSTEMD_UNIT` is `kubelet` and `_UID` is `1000`

#### Multiple filtering options

In case of using multiple following options, conditions between them are logically `AND`ed and within them are logically `OR`ed:

```text
( dmesg )
AND
( priority )
AND
( units[0] OR units[1] OR units[2] OR ... units[U] )
AND
( identifier[0] OR identifier[1] OR identifier[2] OR ... identifier[I] )
AND
( matches[0] OR matches[1] OR matches[2] OR ... matches[M] )
AND
( grep )
```

Consider the following example:

```yaml
- type: journald_input
  matches:
    - _SYSTEMD_UNIT: ssh
    - _SYSTEMD_UNIT: kubelet
      _UID: "1000"
  units:
    - kubelet
    - systemd
  priority: info
  identifiers:
    - systemd
```

The above configuration will be passed to `journalctl` as the following arguments
`journalctl ... --priority=info --unit=kubelet --unit=systemd --identifier=systemd _SYSTEMD_UNIT=ssh + _SYSTEMD_UNIT=kubelet _UID=1000`,
which is going to effectively retrieve all entries which matches the following set of rules:

- `_PRIORITY` is `6`, and
- `_SYSTEMD_UNIT` is `kubelet` or `systemd`, and
- `SYSLOG_IDENTIFIER` `systemd`, and
- entry matches at least one of the following rules:

  - `_SYSTEMD_UNIT` is `ssh`
  - `_SYSTEMD_UNIT` is `kubelet` and `_UID` is `1000`

## Setup and deployment

The user running the collector must have enough permissions to access the journal; not granting them will lead to issues.

When running in a containerized environment, differences in the systemd version running on the host and on the container may prevent access to logs due to different features and configurations (e.g. zstd compression, keyed hash etc).

### Docker

When running otelcol in a container, note that:

1. the container must run as a user that has permission to access the logs
2. the path to the log directory (`/run/log/journal`, `/var/log/journal`...) must be mounted in the container
3. depending on your guest system, you might need to explicitly set the log directory in the configuration

Please note that *the official otelcol images do not contain the journald binary*; you will need to create your custom image or find one that does.

### Linux packaging

When installing otelcol as a linux package, you will most likely need to add the `otelcol-contrib` or `otel` user to the `systemd-journal` group. The exact user and group might vary depending on your package and linux distribution of choice.

You can test if the user has sufficient permissions by running something like (you might need to adjust according to available shell and opentelemetry user)

```sh
sudo su -s /bin/bash -c 'journalctl --lines 5' otelcol-contrib
```

if the permissions are set correctly you will see some logs, otherwise a clear error message.

### Kubernetes

See the instructions for [Docker](#Docker) and adapt according to your Kubernetes distribution and node OS.
