The Cisco OS Receiver is a modular receiver that collects metrics from Cisco network devices via SSH connections. It supports multiple scrapers for comprehensive network monitoring and provides native OpenTelemetry OTLP metrics generation.

## Configuration

The following settings are available:

| Setting | Type | Required | Description |
|---------|------|----------|-------------|
| `devices` | []DeviceConfig | Yes | List of Cisco devices to monitor |
| `collection_interval` | duration | No | How often to collect metrics (default: 60s) |
| `timeout` | duration | No | SSH connection and command timeout (default: 30s) |
| `scrapers` | map | Yes | Scrapers to enable |

### Device Configuration

Each device configuration contains device information and authentication settings following semantic conventions:

| Setting | Type | Required | Description |
|---------|------|----------|-------------|
| `device.host.name` | string | No | Human-readable device name |
| `device.host.ip` | string | Yes | Device IP address |
| `device.host.port` | int | Yes | SSH port (typically 22) |
| `auth.username` | string | Yes | SSH username for authentication |
| `auth.password` | string | No* | Password for authentication |
| `auth.key_file` | string | No* | Path to SSH private key file |

*Either `auth.password` or `auth.key_file` is required, but not both.

### Scrapers Configuration

The scrapers are configured as modular components. Each scraper type can be configured individually:

| Setting | Type | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| `system` | map | System metrics (device availability, collection duration) |

## Metrics Collected

### System Metrics
- `cisco.device.up` - Device availability (1=up, 0=down)
- `cisco.collector.duration.seconds` - Duration of collector scrape in seconds
- `cisco.system.cpu.utilization` - CPU utilization as a fraction (0-1)
  - NX-OS: Calculated from `show system resources` (user + kernel)
  - IOS/IOS XE: Calculated from `show process cpu` (5-second average)
- `cisco.system.memory.utilization` - Memory utilization as a fraction (0-1)
  - NX-OS: Calculated from `show system resources` (used / total)
  - IOS/IOS XE: Calculated from `show process memory` (Processor Pool used / total)

### Resource Attributes
- `cisco.device.name` - Device name
- `cisco.device.ip` - Device IP address
- `cisco.device.model` - Device model
