The Cisco OS Receiver is a modular receiver that collects metrics from Cisco network devices via SSH connections. It supports multiple scrapers for comprehensive network monitoring and provides native OpenTelemetry OTLP metrics generation.

## Configuration

The following settings are available:

| Setting | Type | Required | Description |
|---------|------|----------|-------------|
| `devices` | []DeviceConfig | Yes | List of Cisco devices to monitor |
| `collection_interval` | duration | No | How often to collect metrics (default: 60s) |
| `timeout` | duration | No | SSH connection and command timeout (default: 30s) |
| `scrapers` | map | Yes | Scrapers to enable |

### Device Configuration

| Setting | Type | Required | Description |
|---------|------|----------|-------------|
| `host` | string | Yes | Device address in `host:port` format |
| `username` | string | Yes | SSH username for authentication |
| `password` | string | No* | Password for authentication |
| `key_file` | string | No* | Path to SSH private key file |

*Either `password` or `key_file` is required, but not both.

### Scrapers Configuration

The scrapers are configured as groups.

| Setting | Type | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| `bgp` | map | BGP session metrics configuration |
| `environment` | map | Temperature and power metrics configuration |
| `facts` | map | System information metrics configuration |
| `interfaces` | map | Interface status and statistics configuration |
| `optics` | map | Optical transceiver metrics configuration |

Each scraper can be enabled by simply including it in the configuration, or disabled by omitting it. Future versions may support scraper-specific configuration options within each group.

## Scrapers

The receiver supports the following scrapers:

- **BGP**: Collects BGP session information and statistics
- **Environment**: Collects temperature and power consumption metrics  
- **Facts**: Collects system information (OS version, memory, CPU utilization)
- **Interfaces**: Collects interface statistics (bytes, packets, errors)
- **Optics**: Collects optical signal strength information

## Example Configuration
