This receiver creates stats by connecting to an SSH server which may be an SFTP server.

## Prerequisites

If `ignore_host_key` is not set then host key validation requires the agent either have a known_hosts file at a path specified by setting `known_hosts` or at default paths indicated by ssh man pages: $HOME/.ssh/known_hosts or /etc/ssh/known_hosts.

## Configuration

The following settings are required:
- `endpoint`
- `username`
- `password` or `key_file`

Either `password` or `key_file` must be set. But if both are set then password is treated as the `passphrase` and the key is assumed to be encrypted.

The following settings are optional:

- `collection_interval` (default = `60s`): This receiver collects metrics on an interval. Valid time units are `ns`, `us` (or `µs`), `ms`, `s`, `m`, `h`.
- `known_hosts` (default = ssh defaults): The path to the known_hosts file. If this isn't set then default locations are checked at `$HOME/.ssh/known_hosts` and `/etc/ssh/known_hosts`.
- `ignore_host_key` (default = false): Can override conventional ssh security for use cases like tests where authentication via the known_hosts file isn't required.

### Example Configuration

**Basic SSH check with password authentication:**

```yaml
receivers:
  sshcheck:
    endpoint: localhost:2222
    username: otelu
    password: $OTELP
    collection_interval: 60s
```

**SSH check with key file authentication:**

```yaml
receivers:
  sshcheck:
    endpoint: sftp.example.com:22
    username: monitoring
    key_file: /path/to/private_key
    collection_interval: 60s
```

**SSH check with SFTP monitoring enabled:**

```yaml
receivers:
  sshcheck:
    endpoint: sftp.example.com:22
    username: monitoring
    key_file: /path/to/private_key
    check_sftp: true
    collection_interval: 60s
```

**Production-ready configuration with processors and exporters:**

```yaml
receivers:
  sshcheck:
    endpoint: production-server.example.com:22
    username: monitoring
    key_file: /etc/otel/ssh_monitoring_key
    collection_interval: 30s
    timeout: 5s
    known_hosts: /etc/otel/known_hosts

processors:
  batch:
    timeout: 10s
    send_batch_size: 100

exporters:
  otlp_grpc:
    endpoint: otel-collector:4317

service:
  pipelines:
    metrics:
      receivers: [sshcheck]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [otlp_grpc]
```

The full list of settings exposed for this receiver are documented in [config.go](./config.go) with detailed sample configurations in [testdata/config.yaml](./testdata/config.yaml).

## Advanced Configuration

### Timeout Configuration

The `timeout` option controls how long the receiver waits for an SSH connection to establish. The default is `10s`. This timeout applies to both SSH and SFTP connection attempts.

```yaml
receivers:
  sshcheck:
    endpoint: slow-server.example.com:22
    username: user
    password: pass
    timeout: 30s  # Increase timeout for slow connections
```

### SFTP Check Configuration

SFTP checks can be enabled in two ways:

1. **Using the `check_sftp` option** (enables SFTP status and duration metrics):
```yaml
receivers:
  sshcheck:
    check_sftp: true
```

2. **By enabling SFTP metrics individually**:
```yaml
receivers:
  sshcheck:
    metrics:
      sshcheck.sftp_duration:
        enabled: true
      sshcheck.sftp_status:
        enabled: true
```

When `check_sftp` is enabled or SFTP metrics are individually enabled, the receiver will attempt to establish an SFTP connection after a successful SSH connection. Note that SFTP checks require a successful SSH connection first (see Limitations section).

### Metric Enable/Disable Configuration

Individual metrics can be enabled or disabled using the `metrics` configuration section. By default, all SSH metrics are enabled and all SFTP metrics are disabled.

```yaml
receivers:
  sshcheck:
    endpoint: localhost:2222
    username: user
    password: pass
    metrics:
      sshcheck.duration:
        enabled: true  # Default: true
      sshcheck.status:
        enabled: true  # Default: true
      sshcheck.error:
        enabled: true  # Default: true
      sshcheck.sftp_duration:
        enabled: false  # Default: false
      sshcheck.sftp_status:
        enabled: false  # Default: false
      sshcheck.sftp_error:
        enabled: false  # Default: false
```

See [metadata.yaml](./metadata.yaml) for the complete list of available metrics and their default states.

### Known Hosts Configuration

The `known_hosts` option specifies the path to the SSH known_hosts file for host key validation. If not specified, the receiver checks default locations:
- `$HOME/.ssh/known_hosts`
- `/etc/ssh/known_hosts`

```yaml
receivers:
  sshcheck:
    endpoint: server.example.com:22
    username: user
    key_file: /path/to/key
    known_hosts: /custom/path/to/known_hosts
```

### Security Considerations

The `ignore_host_key` option disables host key validation. **This should only be used in test environments** as it makes the connection vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.

```yaml
receivers:
  sshcheck:
    ignore_host_key: true  # ⚠️ Only for testing!
```

For production use, always configure proper host key validation using `known_hosts` or ensure the host key is in the default known_hosts locations.

## Limitations and Warnings

### Security

- **Authentication**: Passwords in configuration files should be stored securely. Consider using environment variables or secret management systems. Key file authentication is recommended for production use.

### Performance

- **Connection Overhead**: Each check creates a new SSH connection. The `collection_interval` should be configured based on your monitoring needs and the impact on the SSH server. More frequent checks (e.g., every 10 seconds) will create more connections.

- **Timeout Behavior**: If a connection times out, it will be retried on the next collection interval. Ensure your `timeout` value is appropriate for your network conditions.

## Feature Gates

This receiver does not currently use any feature gates. All functionality is available through configuration options. 

## Metrics

This receiver produces the following metrics:

| Metric Name | Type | Description | Unit | Enabled by Default |
|------------|------|-------------|------|-------------------|
| `sshcheck.duration` | Gauge | Measures the duration of SSH connection | ms | Yes |
| `sshcheck.status` | Sum | 1 if SSH client successfully connected, otherwise 0 | 1 | Yes |
| `sshcheck.error` | Sum | Records errors occurring during SSH check | {error} | Yes |
| `sshcheck.sftp_duration` | Gauge | Measures SFTP request duration | ms | No |
| `sshcheck.sftp_status` | Sum | 1 if SFTP server replied to request, otherwise 0 | 1 | No |
| `sshcheck.sftp_error` | Sum | Records errors occurring during SFTP check | {error} | No |

### Resource Attributes

The receiver adds the following resource attribute:
- `ssh.endpoint`: The full SSH endpoint being monitored (disabled by default, can be enabled in metadata.yaml)

### Detailed Metric Documentation

Complete details about the metrics produced by this receiver, including attributes, types, and units, can be found in [documentation.md](./documentation.md) and [metadata.yaml](./metadata.yaml).
