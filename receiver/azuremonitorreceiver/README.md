This receiver scrapes Azure Monitor API for resources metrics.

## Configuration

The following settings are required:

- `subscription_id`

The following settings are optional:

- `auth` (default = service_principal): Specifies the used authentication method. Supported values are `service_principal`, `workload_identity`.
- `resource_groups` (default = none): Filter metrics for specific resource groups, not setting a value will scrape metrics for all resources in the subscription.
- `services` (default = none): Filter metrics for specific services, not setting a value will scrape metrics for all services integrated with Azure Monitor.
- `cache_resources` (default = 86400): List of resources will be cached for the provided amount of time in seconds.
- `cache_resources_definitions` (default = 86400): List of metrics definitions will be cached for the provided amount of time in seconds.
- `maximum_number_of_metrics_in_a_call` (default = 20): Maximum number of metrics to fetch in per API call, current limit in Azure is 20 (as of 03/27/2023).
- `initial_delay` (default = `1s`): defines how long this receiver waits before starting.
- `cloud` (default = `AzureCloud`): defines which Azure cloud to use. Either `AzureCloud` or `AzureUSGovernment`

Authenticating using service principal requires following additional settings:

- `tenant_id`
- `client_id`
- `client_secret`

Authenticating using workload identities requires following additional settings:

- `tenant_id`
- `client_id`
- `federate_token_file`

### Example Configurations

Using Service Principal for authentication:

```yaml
receivers:
  azuremonitor:
    subscription_id: "${subscription_id}"
    tenant_id: "${tenant_id}"
    client_id: "${client_id}"
    client_secret: "${env:CLIENT_SECRET}"
    cloud: AzureUSGovernment
    resource_groups:
      - "${resource_group1}"
      - "${resource_group2}"
    services:
      - "${service1}"
      - "${service2}"
    collection_interval: 60s
    initial_delay: 1s
```

Using Azure Workload Identity for authentication:

```yaml
receivers:
  azuremonitor:
    subscription_id: "${subscription_id}"
    auth: "workload_identity"
    tenant_id: "${env:AZURE_TENANT_ID}"
    client_id: "${env:AZURE_CLIENT_ID}"
    federated_token_file: "${env:AZURE_FEDERATED_TOKEN_FILE}"
```

## Metrics

Details about the metrics scraped by this receiver can be found in [Supported metrics with Azure Monitor](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/metrics-supported). This receiver adds the prefix "azure_" to all scraped metrics.
