- `resource_groups` (default = none): Filter metrics for specific resource groups, not setting a value will scrape metrics for all resources in the subscription.
- `services` (default = none): Filter metrics for specific services, not setting a value will scrape metrics for all services integrated with Azure Monitor.
- `cache_resources` (default = 86400): List of resources will be cached for the provided amount of time in seconds.
- `cache_resources_definitions` (default = 86400): List of metrics definitions will be cached for the provided amount of time in seconds.
- `maximum_number_of_metrics_in_a_call` (default = 20): Maximum number of metrics to fetch in per API call, current limit in Azure is 20 (as of 03/27/2023).
- `initial_delay` (default = `1s`): defines how long this receiver waits before starting.
