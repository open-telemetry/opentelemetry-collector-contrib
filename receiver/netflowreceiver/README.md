The netflow receiver can listen for [netflow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetFlow), [sflow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SFlow), and [ipfix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_Flow_Information_Export) data and convert it to OpenTelemetry logs. The receiver is based on the [goflow2](https://github.com/netsampler/goflow2) project.

This gives OpenTelemetry users the capability of monitoring network traffic, and answer questions like:

* Which protocols are passing through the network?
* Which servers and clients are producing the highest amount of traffic?
* What ports are involved in these network calls?
* How many bytes and packets are being sent and received?

## Getting started

By default the receiver will listen for ipfix and netflow on port `2055`. The receiver can be configured to listen on different ports and protocols.

Example configuration:

```yaml
receivers:
  netflow:
    - scheme: netflow
      port: 2055
      sockets: 16
      workers: 32
  netflow/sflow:
    - scheme: sflow
      port: 6343
      sockets: 16
      workers: 32
  netflow/raw:
    - scheme: netflow
      port: 2055
      sockets: 16
      workers: 32
      send_raw: true

processors:
  batch:
    send_batch_size: 2000
    timeout: 30s

exporters:
  debug:
    verbosity: detailed

service:
  pipelines:
    logs:
      receivers: [netflow, netflow/sflow]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [debug]
  telemetry:
    logs:
      level: debug
```

We recommend using the batch processor to reduce the number of log requests being sent to the exporter. The batch processor will batch log records together and send them in a single request to the exporter.

You would then configure your network devices to send netflow, sflow, or ipfix data to the Collector on the specified ports.

## Configuration

| Field | Description | Examples | Default |
|-------|-------------|--------| ------- |
| scheme | The type of flow data that to receive | `sflow`, `netflow` | `netflow` |
| hostname | The hostname or IP address to bind to | `localhost` | `0.0.0.0` |
| port | The port to bind to | `2055` or `6343` | `2055` |
| sockets | The number of sockets to use | 1 | 1 |
| workers | The number of workers used to decode incoming flow messages | 2 | 2 |
| queue_size | The size of the incoming netflow packets queue, it will always be at least 1000. | 5000 | 1000 |
| send_raw   | Whether to send raw flow messages instead of parsing them                        | `true`, `false`    | `false`   |

When `send_raw` is set to `true`, the receiver will:

- Skip parsing the netflow/sflow messages
- Send the raw message as the log body

## Data format

The netflow data is standardized for the different schemas and is converted to OpenTelemetry log records following the [semantic conventions](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attributes/#server-client-and-shared-network-attributes)

The log record will have the following attributes (with examples):

* **source.address**: Str(132.189.238.100)
* **source.port**: Int(1255)
* **destination.address**: Str(241.171.33.110)
* **destination.port**: Int(64744)
* **network.transport**: Str(tcp)
* **network.type**: Str(ipv4)
* **flow.io.bytes**: Int(853)
* **flow.io.packets**: Int(83)
* **flow.type**: Str(netflow_v5)
* **flow.sequence_num**: Int(191)
* **flow.time_received**: Int(1736309689918929427)
* **flow.start**: Int(1736309689830846400)
* **flow.end**: Int(1736309689871846400)
* **flow.sampling_rate**: Int(0)
* **flow.sampler_address**: Str(172.28.176.1)
* **flow.tcp_flags**: Int(0)

The log record timestamps will be:

* **Observed timestamp**: The time the flow was received.
* **Timestamp**: The flow `start` field.  

### Schema support

* Extract the attributes documented above
* Mapping of custom fields is not yet supported

#### sflow

* Process [sFlow version 5](https://sflow.org/sflow_version_5.txt) datagrams
* `flow_sample` and `flow_sample_expanded` are supported.
* `counter_sample` and `counter_sample_expanded` are NOT yet supported.
* Mapping of custom fields is not yet supported
