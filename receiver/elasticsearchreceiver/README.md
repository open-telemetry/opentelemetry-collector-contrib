This receiver queries the Elasticsearch [node stats](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/cluster-nodes-stats.html), [cluster health](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/cluster-health.html) and [index stats](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/indices-stats.html) endpoints in order to scrape metrics from a running elasticsearch cluster.

## Prerequisites

This receiver supports Elasticsearch versions 7.9+

If Elasticsearch security features are enabled, you must have either the `monitor` or `manage` cluster privilege.
See the [Elasticsearch docs](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/authorization.html) for more information on authorization and [Security privileges](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/security-privileges.html).

## Configuration

The following settings are optional:

- `metrics` (default: see `DefaultMetricsSettings` [here](./internal/metadata/generated_metrics.go): Allows enabling and disabling specific metrics from being collected in this receiver.
- `nodes` (default: `["_all"]`): Allows specifying node filters that define which nodes are scraped for node-level and cluster-level metrics. See [the Elasticsearch documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.9/cluster.html#cluster-nodes) for allowed filters. If this option is left explicitly empty, then no node-level metrics will be scraped and cluster-level metrics will scrape only metrics related to cluster's health.
- `skip_cluster_metrics` (default: `false`): If true, cluster-level metrics will not be scraped.
- `indices` (default: `["_all"]`): Allows specifying index filters that define which indices are scraped for index-level metrics. See [the Elasticsearch documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/indices-stats.html#index-stats-api-path-params) for allowed filters. If this option is left explicitly empty, then no index-level metrics will be scraped.
- `endpoint` (default = `http://localhost:9200`): The base URL of the Elasticsearch API for the cluster to monitor.
- `username` (no default): Specifies the username used to authenticate with Elasticsearch using basic auth. Must be specified if password is specified.
- `password` (no default): Specifies the password used to authenticate with Elasticsearch using basic auth. Must be specified if username is specified.
- `collection_interval` (default = `10s`): This receiver collects metrics on an interval. This value must be a string readable by Golang's [time.ParseDuration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration). On larger clusters, the interval may need to be lengthened, as querying Elasticsearch for metrics will take longer on clusters with more nodes.
- `initial_delay` (default = `1s`): defines how long this receiver waits before starting.

### Example Configuration

```yaml
receivers:
  elasticsearch:
    metrics:
      elasticsearch.node.fs.disk.available:
        enabled: false
    nodes: ["_local"]
    skip_cluster_metrics: true
    indices: [".geoip_databases"]
    endpoint: http://localhost:9200
    username: otel
    password: password
    collection_interval: 10s
```

The full list of settings exposed for this receiver are documented [here](./config.go) with detailed sample configurations [here](./testdata/config.yaml).

## Metrics

The following metric are available with versions:

- `elasticsearch.indexing_pressure.memory.limit` >= [7.10](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.16/release-notes-7.10.0.html)
- `elasticsearch.node.shards.data_set.size` >= [7.13](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.16/release-notes-7.13.0.html)
- `elasticsearch.cluster.state_update.count` >= [7.16.0](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.16/release-notes-7.16.0.html)
- `elasticsearch.cluster.state_update.time` >= [7.16.0](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.16/release-notes-7.16.0.html)

Details about the metrics produced by this receiver can be found in [metadata.yaml](./metadata.yaml)

## Feature gate configurations

See the [Collector feature gates](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/main/featuregate/README.md#collector-feature-gates) for an overview of feature gates in the collector.

**BETA**: `receiver.elasticsearch.emitNodeVersionAttr`

The feature gate `receiver.elasticsearch.emitNodeVersionAttr` when enabled will enrich all node metrics with an
resource attribute representing the node version.

This feature gate is enabled by default, and eventually the old implementation will be removed. It aims to give users time
to migrate to the new implementation. The target release for this featuregate to be permanently enabled is 0.82.0.
