## Metrics

These are the metrics available for this scraper.

| Name | Description | Unit | Type | Attributes |
| ---- | ----------- | ---- | ---- | ---------- |
| **elasticsearch.cluster.data_nodes** | The number of data nodes in the cluster. | {nodes} | Sum(Int) | <ul> </ul> |
| **elasticsearch.cluster.health** | The health status of the cluster. Health status is based on the state of its primary and replica shards. Green indicates all shards are assigned. Yellow indicates that one or more replica shards are unassigned. Red indicates that one or more primary shards are unassigned, making some data unavailable. | {status} | Sum(Int) | <ul> <li>health_status</li> </ul> |
| **elasticsearch.cluster.nodes** | The total number of nodes in the cluster. | {nodes} | Sum(Int) | <ul> </ul> |

| **elasticsearch.node.cluster.connections** | The number of open tcp connections for internal cluster communication. | {connections} | Sum(Int) | <ul> </ul> |
| **elasticsearch.node.cluster.io** | The number of bytes sent and received on the network for internal cluster communication. | By | Sum(Int) | <ul> <li>direction</li> </ul> |
| **elasticsearch.node.documents** | The number of documents on the node. | {documents} | Sum(Int) | <ul> <li>document_state</li> </ul> |
| **elasticsearch.node.fs.disk.available** | The amount of disk space available across all file stores for this node. | By | Sum(Int) | <ul> </ul> |
| **elasticsearch.node.http.connections** | The number of HTTP connections to the node. | {connections} | Sum(Int) | <ul> </ul> |

| **elasticsearch.node.shards.size** | The size of the shards assigned to this node. | By | Sum(Int) | <ul> </ul> |
| **elasticsearch.node.thread_pool.tasks.finished** | The number of tasks finished by the thread pool. | {tasks} | Sum(Int) | <ul> <li>thread_pool_name</li> <li>task_state</li> </ul> |
