This receiver will read pipeline data from JSON files. The data is written in
[Protobuf JSON
encoding](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3#json)
using [OpenTelemetry
protocol](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-proto).

The receiver will watch the directory and read files. If a file is updated or added,
the receiver will read it in its entirety again.

The data is serialized according to the [OpenTelemetry Protocol File Exporter](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/protocol/file-exporter.md).

## Getting Started

The following settings are required:

- `include`: set a glob path of files to include in data collection

Example:

```yaml
receivers:
  otlpjsonfile:
    include:
      - "/var/log/*.log"
    exclude:
      - "/var/log/example.log"
```

## Offset Support (Optional)

The OTLP JSON File Receiver supports optional file offset tracking for enhanced data lineage and debugging capabilities. **By default, offset tracking is disabled to maintain backward compatibility.**

### Configuration

To enable offset tracking, add these configuration options:

```yaml
receivers:
  otlpjsonfile:
    include:
      - "/var/log/*.log"
    # Enable offset tracking (optional)
    include_file_record_offset: true    # Add byte offset information
    include_file_record_number: true    # Add record number information
```

### Offset Attributes

When enabled, the following attributes are automatically added to each record:

- **`log.file.record_offset`**: The byte offset in the file where this specific record starts
- **`log.file.record_number`**: A sequential number indicating the order in which records were processed from the file

These attributes are added to:
- **Logs**: Added to each `LogRecord`'s attributes
- **Traces**: Added to each `Span`'s attributes
- **Metrics**: Added to each `Metric`'s metadata
- **Profiles**: Added to each `ResourceProfile`'s resource attributes

### Restart Behavior

The receiver uses the underlying fileconsumer infrastructure which provides:

- **Automatic restart recovery**: When the collector restarts, it resumes reading from the last known offset
- **Persistent state**: Offset information is stored using the configured storage extension
- **File rotation handling**: Seamlessly handles log rotation, file moves, and deletions
- **No data loss**: Ensures all data is processed exactly once, even across restarts

### Configuration with Storage

To enable persistent offset tracking across restarts, configure a storage extension:

```yaml
extensions:
  file_storage:
    directory: ./storage

receivers:
  otlpjsonfile:
    include:
      - "/var/log/*.log"
    storage: file_storage
    # Enable offset tracking
    include_file_record_offset: true
    include_file_record_number: true

service:
  extensions: [file_storage]
  pipelines:
    logs:
      receivers: [otlpjsonfile]
```

Without a storage extension, the receiver will track offsets in memory but will restart from the beginning when the collector restarts.

### Example Output

With offset support enabled, your telemetry data will include offset information:

```json
{
  "resourceLogs": [{
    "scopeLogs": [{
      "logRecords": [{
        "body": "example log message",
        "attributes": {
          "log.file.record_offset": 0,
          "log.file.record_number": 1,
          "other.attribute": "value"
        }
      }]
    }]
  }]
}
```
