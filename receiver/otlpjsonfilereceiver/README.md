This receiver will read pipeline data from JSON files. The data is written in
[Protobuf JSON
encoding](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3#json)
using [OpenTelemetry
protocol](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-proto).

The receiver will watch the directory and read files. If a file is updated or added,
the receiver will read it in its entirety again.

The data is serialized according to the [OpenTelemetry Protocol File Exporter](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/protocol/file-exporter.md).

## Getting Started

The following settings are required:

- `include`: set a glob path of files to include in data collection

Example:

```yaml
receivers:
  otlpjsonfile:
    include:
      - "/var/log/*.log"
    exclude:
      - "/var/log/example.log"
```

## Configuration

| `replay_file`              | `false`          | If `true`, the receiver will not track file offsets and will re-read files from the beginning on every poll.                                                                                                                                                    |

For additional configuration options, see the [File Log Receiver documentation](../filelogreceiver/README.md#configuration).

### Handling Copytruncate Rotation

When log files are rotated using the `copytruncate` strategy (where the file is copied and then truncated in place), the receiver can detect when a file has been truncated by comparing the stored offset with the current file size. The `on_truncate` setting controls how the receiver behaves when truncation is detected:

- `ignore` (default): The receiver keeps the original offset and will not read any data until the file grows past the original offset. This prevents duplicate log ingestion when a file is rotated.
- `read_whole_file`: The receiver resets the offset to 0 and reads the entire file from the beginning. Use this mode when you want to ensure no data loss, even if it means potentially re-reading some logs.
- `read_new`: The receiver updates the offset to the current file size (the position after truncation). This allows reading new data that is written after the truncation without re-reading existing content.

**Example configuration:**

```yaml
receivers:
  otlpjsonfile:
    include:
      - /var/log/otlp/*.json
    on_truncate: read_whole_file  # Read entire file after copytruncate rotation
```
