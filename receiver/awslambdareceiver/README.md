## Overview

A receiver for collecting logs & metrics from AWS services via Lambda invocations. 
AWS Lambda is a popular serverless service used extensively for event-driven architectures. 
Many AWS services (S3, CloudWatch, SNS, SQS) can trigger Lambda functions, making it an ideal entry point for collecting data from AWS services.
This receiver is designed to run as part of an OpenTelemetry Collector deployed as an AWS Lambda function.

The `awslambdareceiver` enables users to:

- Collect logs & metrics stored at various AWS services as OTel native log records & metric data points
- Collect custom logs via AWS services that can trigger Lambda functions
- Decode/Unmarshal AWS-specific log formats using OpenTelemetry encoding extensions
- Leverage OpenTelemetry's processors to further enrich, filter, or transform collected data before exporting

## How It Works

The `awslambdareceiver` operates as follows:

1. Accepts Lambda Invocations
2. Identifies the event source (S3, CloudWatch, etc.)
3. Uses configured encoding extensions to parse the data
4. Creates OpenTelemetry records matching the data type (logs, metrics)
5. Forward derived records to the next component in the pipeline (processors, exporters)

## Event handling

The receiver automatically detects the event source based on the Lambda invocation message format.
Sections below describe various details about event handling by this component.

### Supported event types

- **Logs**: Supported through S3 and CloudWatch Logs Subscription Filters
- **Metrics**: Supported through S3

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Currently, metrics mode will always use `awscloudwatchmetricstreams_encoding` extension regardless of the `encoding` parameter set in the receiver configuration.
> Please make sure ingesting metrics can be decoded using this extension.

### S3 Event handling

S3 events are handled in the following manner:

- Received S3 event notification (for example, using Lambda trigger on `s3:ObjectCreated:*`)
- Download S3 object payload
- Decode payload using the configured encoding extension
  - Default encoding: Preserve S3 object content as-is
  - Custom encoding: Use specified encoding extension (for example, `awslogs_encoding` for AWS log formats)

### CloudWatch Logs Subscription Filters

CloudWatch Logs events are handled in the following manner:

- Receive CloudWatch Logs subscription filter event
- Parse the CloudWatch Logs message (note - unlike S3 events, the payload is included in the event)
- Decode payload using the configured encoding extension
  - Default encoding: Parse CloudWatch Logs messages to OpenTelemetry log records
  - Custom encoding: Use specified encoding extension (for example, `awslogs_encoding` for AWS log formats)

## Configuration

The following receiver configuration parameters are supported.

| Name                  | Description                                             |
|:----------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------|
| `s3:encoding`         | Optional encoder to use for S3 event processing         | 
| `cloudwatch:encoding` | Optional encoder to use for CloudWatch event processing | 

### Example Configuration

### Example 1: VPC Flow Logs from S3

```yaml
receivers:
  awslambda:
    s3:
      encoding: awslogs_encoding

extensions:
  awslogs_encoding:
    format: vpcflow
    vpcflow:
      file_format: plain-text

exporters:
  otlphttp:
    endpoint: "https://my-backend:443"

service:
  extensions:
    - awslogs_encoding
  pipelines:
    logs:
      receivers: [awslambda]
      exporters: [otlphttp]
```

In this example, the `awslambdareceiver` is expected to be triggered when a VPC flow log is created at S3 bucket.
The receiver retrieves the log file from S3 and decodes it using the `awslogs_encoding` extension with the `vpcflow` format.
Parsed logs are forwarded to an OTLP listener via the `otlphttp` exporter.

### Example 2: ELB Access Logs from S3

```yaml
receivers:
  awslambda:
    s3:
      encoding: awslogs_encoding

extensions:
  awslogs_encoding:
    format: elbaccess
    elbaccess:
      file_format: plain-text

exporters:
  otlphttp:
    endpoint: "https://my-backend:443"

service:
  extensions:
    - awslogs_encoding
  pipelines:
    logs:
      receivers: [awslambda]
      exporters: [otlphttp]
```

Similar to the first example, this configuration is for collecting ELB access logs stored in S3.

### Example 3: CloudWatch Logs using CloudWatch Subscription Filters

```yaml
receivers:
  awslambda:

exporters:
  otlphttp:
    endpoint: "https://my-backend:443"

service:
  pipelines:
    logs:
      receivers: [awslambda]
      exporters: [otlphttp]
```

For this deployment configuration, when receiver is triggered by a CloudWatch Logs subscription filter, the CloudWatch 
messages will be extracted and converted to an OpenTelemetry log record. 
These logs then get forwarded to an OTLP listener via the `otlphttp` exporter.

### Example 4: Arbitrary S3 content (logs or metrics)

```yaml
receivers:
  awslambda:

exporters:
  otlphttp:
    endpoint: "https://my-backend:443"

service:
  pipelines:
    logs:
      receivers: [awslambda]
      exporters: [otlphttp]
```

For this deployment configuration, when receiver is triggered by an S3 event, 

- Logs: Content of the S3 object will be added to an OpenTelemetry log record. If content is string, then it will be added as-is.
- Metrics: Metrics are always decoded using `awscloudwatchmetricstreams_encoding` extension.

## AWS Permissions

The Lambda function requires the following IAM permissions:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:GetObject"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::your-log-bucket/*"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Error Handling

- Detailed error information is logged for troubleshooting
   
  These logs can be views via the configured CloudWatch Logs group for the Lambda function.

- Error retrying 

  Error retrying can be configured through the Lambda deployment setting.
  For example, errors can be forwarded to a S3 bucket.
