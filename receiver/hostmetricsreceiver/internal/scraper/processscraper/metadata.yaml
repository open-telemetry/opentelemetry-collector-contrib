  process.pid:
    description: Process identifier (PID).
    type: int
  process.executable.name:
    description: >-
      The name of the process executable. On Linux based systems, can be set to the
      Name in proc/[pid]/status. On Windows, can be set to the base name of
      GetProcessImageFileNameW.
    type: string
  process.executable.path:
    description: >-
      The full path to the process executable. On Linux based systems, can be set to
      the target of proc/[pid]/exe. On Windows, can be set to the result of
      GetProcessImageFileNameW.
    type: string
  process.command:
    description: >-
      The command used to launch the process (i.e. the command name). On Linux based
      systems, can be set to the zeroth string in proc/[pid]/cmdline. On Windows, can
      be set to the first parameter extracted from GetCommandLineW.
    type: string
  process.command_line:
    description: >-
      The full command used to launch the process as a single string representing the
      full command. On Windows, can be set to the result of GetCommandLineW. Do not
      set this if you have to assemble it just for monitoring; use
      process.command_args instead.
