The Webhook Event Receiver is a push based event collector component meant to act as a generally available receiver for any webhook style data source. It is designed to work alongside other pipeline components
like the [transform processor](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/processor/transformprocessor) to allow the ingestion of generic events as logs into the opentelemetry 
collector.

## Configuration

The following settings are required:

* `endpoint` (no default): The endpoint where you may point your webhook to emit events to

The following settings are optional:

* `path` (default: '/events'): Path where the receiver instance will accept events 
* `health_path` (default: '/health_check'): Path available for checking receiver status
* `read_timeout` (default: '500ms'): Maximum wait time while attempting to read a received event
* `write_timeout` (default: '500ms'): Maximum wait time while attempting to write a response

Example:
```yaml
receivers:
    webhookevent:
        endpoint: localhost:8088
        read_timeout: "500ms"
        path: "eventsource/receiver"
        health_path: "eventreceiver/healthcheck"
```
The full list of settings exposed for this receiver are documented [here](./config.go) with a detailed sample configuration [here](./testdata/config.yaml)
