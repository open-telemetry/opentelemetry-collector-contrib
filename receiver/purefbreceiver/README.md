The Pure Storage FlashBlade receiver, receives metrics from Pure Storage FlashBlade via the [Pure Storage FlashBlade OpenMetrics Exporter](https://github.com/PureStorage-OpenConnect/pure-fb-openmetrics-exporter)

## Configuration

The following settings are required:
 -  `endpoint` (default: `http://172.31.60.207:9491/metrics/array`): The URL of the scraper selected endpoint

### Important
