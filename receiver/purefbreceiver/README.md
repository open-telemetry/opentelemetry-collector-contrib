The Pure Storage FlashBlade receiver, receives metrics from Pure Storage FlashBlade via the [Pure Storage FlashBlade OpenMetrics Exporter](https://github.com/PureStorage-OpenConnect/pure-fb-openmetrics-exporter)

## Configuration

The following settings are required:
 -  `endpoint` (default: `http://172.31.60.207:9491/metrics/array`): The URL of the scraper selected endpoint

### Important 

- Only endpoints explicitly added on will be scraped. e.g: `clients`

```yaml

  bearertokenauth/fb01:
    token: "..."

    endpoint: http://172.31.60.207:9491/metrics
    arrays:
      - address: fb01
        auth:

    clients:
      - address: fb01
        auth:
