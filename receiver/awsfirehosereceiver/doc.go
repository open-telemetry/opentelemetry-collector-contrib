// Package awsfirehosereceiver implements a receiver that can be used to
// receive requests from the AWS Kinesis Data Firehose and transform them
// into formats usable by the OpenTelemetry collector. The configuration
// determines which unmarshaler to use. Each unmarshaler is responsible for
// processing a Firehose record format that can be sent through the delivery
// stream.
