This value limits the number of batches that will be processed during a single poll interval. A value of 0 indicates no limit.                                           |

Note that _by default_, no logs will be read from a file that is not actively being written to because `start_at` defaults to `end`.

### Operators

Each [operator](../../pkg/stanza/docs/operators/README.md#what-is-an-operator) performs a simple responsibility, such as parsing a timestamp or JSON. Chain together operators to process logs into a desired format.

- Every operator has a `type`.
- Every operator can be given a unique `id`. If you use the same type of operator more than once in a pipeline, you must specify an `id`. Otherwise, the `id` defaults to the value of `type`.
- Operators will output to the next operator in the pipeline. The last operator in the pipeline will emit from the receiver. Optionally, the `output` parameter can be used to specify the `id` of another operator to which logs will be passed directly.
- Only parsers and general purpose operators should be used.

### Multiline configuration

If set, the `multiline` configuration block instructs the `file_input` operator to split log entries on a pattern other than newlines.

The `multiline` configuration block must contain exactly one of `line_start_pattern` or `line_end_pattern`. These are regex patterns that
match either the beginning of a new log entry, or the end of a log entry.

The `omit_pattern` setting can be used to omit the start/end pattern from each entry.

### Supported encodings

| Key        | Description
| ---        | ---                                                              |
| `nop`      | No encoding validation. Treats the file as a stream of raw bytes |
| `utf-8`    | UTF-8 encoding                                                   |
| `utf-16le` | UTF-16 encoding with little-endian byte order                    |
| `utf-16be` | UTF-16 encoding with big-endian byte order                       |
| `ascii`    | ASCII encoding                                                   |
| `big5`     | The Big5 Chinese character encoding                              |

Other less common encodings are supported on a best-effort basis. See [https://www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets/character-sets.xhtml](https://www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets/character-sets.xhtml) for other encodings available.

### Header Metadata Parsing

To enable header metadata parsing, the `filelog.allowHeaderMetadataParsing` feature gate must be set, and `start_at` must be `beginning`.

If set, the file input operator will attempt to read a header from the start of the file. Each header line must match the `header.pattern` pattern. Each line is emitted into a pipeline defined by `header.metadata_operators`. Any attributes on the resultant entry from the embedded pipeline will be merged with the attributes from previous lines (attribute collisions will be resolved with an upsert strategy). After all header lines are read, the final merged header attributes will be present on every log line that is emitted for the file.

The header lines are not emitted by the receiver.

## Additional Terminology and Features

- An [entry](../../pkg/stanza/docs/types/entry.md) is the base representation of log data as it moves through a pipeline. All operators either create, modify, or consume entries.
- A [field](../../pkg/stanza/docs/types/field.md) is used to reference values in an entry.
- A common [expression](../../pkg/stanza/docs/types/expression.md) syntax is used in several operators. For example, expressions can be used to [filter](../../pkg/stanza/docs/operators/filter.md) or [route](../../pkg/stanza/docs/operators/router.md) entries.

### Parsers with Embedded Operations

Many parsers operators can be configured to embed certain followup operations such as timestamp and severity parsing. For more information, see [complex parsers](../../pkg/stanza/docs/types/parsers.md#complex-parsers).

### Time parameters

All time parameters must have the unit of time specified. e.g.: `200ms`, `1s`, `1m`. 

### Log Rotation

File Log Receiver can read files that are being rotated. 

## Example - Tailing a simple json file

Receiver Configuration
```yaml
receivers:
  filelog:
    include: [ /var/log/myservice/*.json ]
    operators:
      - type: json_parser
        timestamp:
          parse_from: attributes.time
          layout: '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'
```

## Example - Tailing a plaintext file

Receiver Configuration
```yaml
receivers:
  filelog:
    include: [ /simple.log ]
    operators:
      - type: regex_parser
        regex: '^(?P<time>\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2} \d{2}:\d{2}:\d{2}) (?P<sev>[A-Z]*) (?P<msg>.*)$'
        timestamp:
          parse_from: attributes.time
          layout: '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'
        severity:
          parse_from: attributes.sev
```

The above configuration will read logs from the "simple.log" file. Some examples of logs that it will read:
```
2023-06-19 05:20:50 ERROR This is a test error message
2023-06-20 12:50:00 DEBUG This is a test debug message
```

## Example - Multiline logs parsing

Receiver Configuration
```yaml
receivers:
  filelog:
    include:
    - /var/log/example/multiline.log
    multiline:
      line_start_pattern: ^Exception
```

The above configuration will be able to parse multiline logs, splitting every time the `^Exception` pattern is met.

```
Exception in thread 1 "main" java.lang.NullPointerException
        at com.example.myproject.Book.getTitle(Book.java:16)
        at com.example.myproject.Author.getBookTitles(Author.java:25)
        at com.example.myproject.Bootstrap.main(Bootstrap.java:14)
Exception in thread 2 "main" java.lang.NullPointerException
        at com.example.myproject.Book.getTitle(Book.java:16)
        at com.example.myproject.Author.getBookTitles(Author.java:25)
        at com.example.myproject.Bootstrap.main(Bootstrap.java:44)
```

## Example - Reading compressed log files

Receiver Configuration
```yaml
receivers:
  filelog:
    include:
    - /var/log/example/compressed.log.gz
    compression: gzip
```

The above configuration will be able to read gzip compressed log files by setting the `compression` option to `gzip`.
When this option is set, all files ending with that suffix are scanned using a gzip reader that decompresses the file content
before scanning through it. Please note that if the compressed file is expected to be updated, the additional compressed logs must be appended to the
compressed file, rather than recompressing the whole content and overwriting the previous file.

## Offset tracking

The `storage` setting allows you to define the proper storage extension for storing file offsets.
While the storage parameter can ensure that log files are consumed accurately, it is possible that
logs are dropped while moving downstream through other components in the collector.
For additional resiliency, see [Fault tolerant log collection example](../../examples/fault-tolerant-logs-collection/README.md)

Here is some of the information the file log receiver stores:
- The number of files it is currently tracking (`knownFiles`).
- For each file being tracked:
  - The [fingerprint](../../pkg/stanza/fileconsumer/design.md#fingerprints) of the file (`Fingerprint.first_bytes`).
  - The byte offset from the start of the file, indicating the position in the file from where the
    file log receiver continues reading the file (`Offset`).
  - An arbitrary set of file attributes, such as the name of the file (`FileAttributes`).

Exactly how this information is serialized depends on the type of storage being used.

## Troubleshooting

### Tracking symlinked files
If the receiver is being used to track a symlinked file and the symlink target is expected to change frequently, make sure 
to set the value of the `poll_interval` setting to something lower than the symlink update frequency.

### Telemetry metrics
Enabling [Collector metrics](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/internal-telemetry/#configure-internal-metrics)
will also provide telemetry metrics for the state of the receiver's file consumption.
Specifically, the `otelcol_fileconsumer_open_files` and `otelcol_fileconsumer_reading_files` metrics
are provided.
