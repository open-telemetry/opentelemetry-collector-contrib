## Internal Telemetry

The following telemetry is emitted by this component.

### otelcol_prometheus_receiver_translation_metric_points_attempted

Number of OTLP metric data points attempted during translation. [Development]

Counts the number of OTLP data points the receiver attempted to create from 
Prometheus data. Each unique label combination within a metric family becomes 
one OTLP data point. For example, a histogram with labels {method="GET"} and 
{method="POST"} counts as 2 metric points, regardless of how many Prometheus 
series (buckets, sum, count) comprise each histogram.


| Unit | Metric Type | Value Type | Monotonic | Stability |
| ---- | ----------- | ---------- | --------- | --------- |
| {datapoints} | Sum | Int | true | Development |

### otelcol_prometheus_receiver_translation_metric_points_dropped

Number of OTLP metric data points dropped during translation. [Development]

Counts OTLP data points that could not be created due to translation failures.
Common causes include incomplete histogram data (missing _count metric) or 
malformed metric families. Compare with prometheus_receiver_translation_metric_points_attempted
to calculate the success rate.
