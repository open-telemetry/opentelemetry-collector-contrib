## Feature Gates

This component has the following feature gates:

| Feature Gate | Stage | Description | From Version | To Version | Reference |
| ------------ | ----- | ----------- | ------------ | ---------- | --------- |
| `receiver.prometheusreceiver.EnableCreatedTimestampZeroIngestion` | alpha | Enables the Prometheus created-timestamps-zero-injection feature. Created timestamps are injected as 0-valued samples when appropriate. This is disabled by default due to worse CPU performance with higher metric volumes. | v0.113.0 | N/A | [Link](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/issues/40355) |
| `receiver.prometheusreceiver.EnableNativeHistograms` | stable | Converts scraped Prometheus native histograms into OpenTelemetry exponential histograms. You still need to configure 'scrape_native_histograms: true' in your Prometheus scrape config to actually scrape native histograms. For mixed histograms (both classic and native), only the native histogram buckets are used. | v0.142.0 | v0.145.0 | [Link](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/pull/34473) |
| `receiver.prometheusreceiver.EnableReportExtraScrapeMetrics` | alpha | Enables reporting of extra Prometheus scrape metrics. This replaces the deprecated 'report_extra_scrape_metrics' configuration option. | v0.143.0 | N/A | [Link](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/issues/44181) |
| `receiver.prometheusreceiver.RemoveReportExtraScrapeMetricsConfig` | beta | When enabled, the 'report_extra_scrape_metrics' configuration option is ignored, and extra scrape metrics are controlled solely by the EnableReportExtraScrapeMetrics feature gate. The intention is to have extra scrape metrics enabled all the time in the future. | v0.143.0 | N/A | [Link](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/issues/44181) |
| `receiver.prometheusreceiver.RemoveStartTimeAdjustment` | stable | When enabled, the Prometheus receiver will leave the start time unset. Use the metricstarttime processor instead if you need this functionality. | v0.121.0 | v0.142.0 | [Link](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/pull/36364) |
| `receiver.prometheusreceiver.UseCreatedMetric` | deprecated | When enabled, the Prometheus receiver will retrieve the start time for Summary, Histogram and Sum metrics from _created metric. | v0.89.0 | v0.141.0 | [Link](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/issues/21909) |
