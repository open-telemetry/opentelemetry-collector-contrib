The Git Provider receiver scrapes data from Version Control Systems (VCS) that use Git as their underlying technology.

As a starting point, this receiver can infer many of the same core VCS metrics across vendors, while being able to receive additional data specific to vendors.

The current default set of metrics common across all vendors can be found in [documentation.md](./documentation.md).

These VCS metrics can be used as leading indicators ([capabilities][doracap])  to the [DORA][dorafour] metrics; helping provide insight into modern-day engineering practices.

## Getting Started

The collection interval is common to all scrapers and is set to 30 seconds by default.

> Note: Generally speaking, if the vendor allows for anonymous API calls, then you
> won't have to configure any authentication, but you may only see public repositories
> and organizations. You may run into significantly more rate limiting.

```yaml
gitprovider:
    collection_interval: <duration> #default = 30s recommended 300s
    scrapers:
        <scraper1>:
        <scraper2>:
        ...
```

A more complete example using the GitHub scrapers with authentication is as follows:

```yaml
extensions:
    bearertokenauth/github:
        token: ${env:GH_PAT}

receivers:
    gitprovider:
        initial_delay: 1s
        collection_interval: 60s
        scrapers:
            github:
                metrics:
                    vcs.repository.contributor.count:
                        enabled: true
                github_org: myfancyorg
                search_query: "org:myfancyorg topic:o11yalltheway" #Recommended optional query override, defaults to "{org,user}:<github_org>"
                endpoint: "https://selfmanagedenterpriseserver.com"
                auth:
                    authenticator: bearertokenauth/github
service:
    extensions: [bearertokenauth/github]
    pipelines:
        metrics:
            receivers: [..., gitprovider]
            processors: []
            exporters: [...]
```

This receiver is developed upstream in the [liatrio-otel-collector distribution](https://github.com/liatrio/liatrio-otel-collector)
where a quick start exists with an [example config](https://github.com/liatrio/liatrio-otel-collector/blob/main/config/config.yaml)

A Grafana Dashboard exists on the marketplace for this receiver and can be
found [here](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/20976-engineering-effectiveness-metrics/).

The available scrapers are:
| Scraper  | Description             |
|----------|-------------------------|
| [github] | VCS Metrics from [GitHub](https://github.com/) |

## GitHub Scraper

> Important:
> * The GitHub scraper does not emit metrics for branches that have not had
>   changes since creation from the default branch (trunk).
> * Due to GitHub API limitations, it is possible for the branch time metric to
>   change when rebases occur, recreating the commits with new timestamps.


For additional context on GitHub scraper limitations and inner workings please
