The Windows Service Receiver is a receiver for scraping information about services running on a Windows machine.

## Getting Started

By default the Windows Service Receiver will attempt to identify and monitor the status of all specified services on the host machine. If the `include_services` field is present but empty the receiver will assume that the user wishes to monitor _ALL_ services present on a machine. Should you wish to monitor a majority of services (but not all) an optional `exclude_services` services field may be included with a list of services you do not wish to see metrics from.

An example of monitoring three services on a host:
```yaml
windowsservice:
  collection_interval: <duration> # default = 1m
  include_services:
    - service1
    - service2
    - service3
    ...
```
The case where you wish to monitor all services present on a host machine, except for `service3`:
```yaml
windowsservice:
  collection_interval: <duration> # default = 1m
  include_services:
  exclude_services:
    - service3
    ...
```
