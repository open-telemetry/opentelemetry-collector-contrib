The Windows Service Receiver is a receiver for scraping information about the state of services running on a Windows machine.

## Getting Started

By default the Windows Service Receiver will attempt to identify and monitor the status of all specified services on the host machine.

An example of monitoring three services on a host:

```yaml
windowsservice:
  collection_interval: <duration> # default = 1m
  include_services:
    - service1
    - service2
    - service3
    ...
```

The case where you wish to monitor all services present on a host machine, except for `service3`:

```yaml
windowsservice:
  collection_interval: <duration> # default = 1m
  include_services:
  exclude_services:
    - service3
    ...
```
