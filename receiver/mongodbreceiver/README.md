This receiver fetches stats from a MongoDB instance using the [golang
mongo driver](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-go-driver). Stats are collected
via MongoDB's `dbStats` and `serverStatus` commands.

## Purpose

The purpose of this receiver is to allow users to monitor metrics from standalone MongoDB clusters. This includes non-Atlas managed MongoDB Servers.

## Prerequisites

This receiver supports MongoDB versions:

- 4.0+
- 5.0
- 6.0
- 7.0

Mongodb recommends to set up a least privilege user (LPU) with a [`clusterMonitor` role](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/v5.0/reference/built-in-roles/#mongodb-authrole-clusterMonitor) in order to collect metrics. Please refer to [lpu.sh](./testdata/integration/scripts/lpu.sh) for an example of how to configure these permissions.

## Configuration

The following settings are optional:

- `hosts` (default: [`localhost:27017`]): list of `host:port` or unix domain socket endpoints.The `transport` option is no longer available.
  - For standalone MongoDB deployments this is the hostname and port of the mongod instance
  - For replica sets specify the hostnames and ports of the mongod instances that are in the replica set configuration. If the `replica_set` field is specified, nodes will be autodiscovered.
  - For a sharded MongoDB deployment, please specify a list of the `mongos` hosts.
- `username`: If authentication is required, the user can with `clusterMonitor` permissions can be provided here.
- `password`: If authentication is required, the password can be provided here.
- `collection_interval`: (default = `1m`): This receiver collects metrics on an interval. This value must be a string readable by Golang's [time.ParseDuration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration). Valid time units are `ns`, `us` (or `Âµs`), `ms`, `s`, `m`, `h`.
- `initial_delay` (default = `1s`): defines how long this receiver waits before starting.
- `replica_set`: If the deployment of MongoDB is a replica set then this allows users to specify the replica set name which allows for autodiscovery of other nodes in the replica set.
- `timeout`: (default = `1m`) The timeout of running commands against mongo.
- `tls`: (defaults defined [here](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/main/config/configtls/README.md)): TLS control. By default insecure settings are rejected and certificate verification is on.
- `direct_connection`: If true, then the driver will not try to autodiscover other nodes, and perform instead a direct connection o the host.

### Example Configuration

```yaml
receivers:
  mongodb:
    hosts:
      - endpoint: localhost:27017
    username: otel
    password: ${env:MONGODB_PASSWORD}
    collection_interval: 60s
    initial_delay: 1s
    tls:
      insecure: true
      insecure_skip_verify: true
```

The full list of settings exposed for this receiver are documented [here](./config.go) with detailed sample configurations [here](./testdata/config.yaml).

## Metrics

The following metric are available with versions:

- `mongodb.extent.count` < 4.4 with mmapv1 storage engine

Details about the metrics produced by this receiver can be found in [metadata.yaml](./metadata.yaml)

## Feature gate configurations

See the [Collector feature gates](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/main/featuregate/README.md#collector-feature-gates) for an overview of feature gates in the collector.

**STABLE**: `receiver.mongodb.removeDatabaseAttr`

The feature gate `receiver.mongodb.removeDatabaseAttr`  will remove the database name attribute from data points 
because it is already found on the resource. This feature gate cannot be changed and will be removed soon.
