The Loki receiver implements the [Loki push api](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/clients/promtail/#loki-push-api) as specified [here](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/api/#push-log-entries-to-loki). 
It allows Promtail instances to specify the open telemetry collector as their lokiAddress.

This receiver runs HTTP and GRPC servers to ingest log entries in Loki format.

## Getting Started

The settings are:

- `endpoint` (required, default = 0.0.0.0:3500 for HTTP protocol, 0.0.0.0:3600 gRPC protocol): host:port to which the receiver is going to receive data.
- `use_incoming_timestamp` (optional, default = false) if set `true` the timestamp from Loki log entry is used

Example:
```yaml
receivers:
  loki:
    protocols:
      http:
      grpc:
    use_incoming_timestamp: true
```
