# receiver_creator

This receiver can instantiate other receivers at runtime based on whether observed endpoints match a configured rule. These rules are evaluated for each endpoint discovered. If the rule evaluates to true then the receiver for that rule will be started against the matched endpoint.

## Config

**watch_observers**

A list of observers previously defined to be run in the `extensions` section. receiver_creator will watch for endpoints generated by these observers.

**receivers**

A map of receiver names (e.g. `redis/1`) to a template for when and how to instantiate that receiver.

**receivers.&lt;receiver_type/id&gt;.rule**

Rule string using [expvar syntax](https://github.com/antonmedv/expr/blob/master/docs/Language-Definition.md). Variables available are detailed below in [Endpoints](#endpoints).

Each rule must start with `type.(pod|port) &&` such that the rule matches only one endpoint type.

**receivers.&lt;receiver_type/id&gt;.config**

This is configuration that will be used when creating the receiver at runtime. This config is merged with the config discovered at runtime.

This option can use static and dynamic configuration values. Static values are normal YAML values. However the value can also be dynamically constructed from the discovered endpoint object. Dynamic values are surrounded by backticks (\`). If a literal backtick is needed use \\` to escape it. Dynamic values can be used with static values in which case they are concatenated. For example:

```yaml
config:
   secure_url: https://`pod.labels["secure_host"]`
```

The value of `secure_url` will be `https://` concatenated with the value of the `secure_host` label.

This can also be used when the discovered endpoint needs to be changed dynamically. For instance, suppose the IP `1.2.3.4` is discovered without a port but the port needs to be set inside endpoint. You could do:

```yaml
config:
   endpoint: `endpoint`:8080
```

## Endpoints

Depending on the type of endpoint it will have different variables available.

### Pod

| Variable  | Description                  |
|-----------|------------------------------|
| type.pod  | `true`                       |
| name      | name of the pod              |
| labels    | map of labels set on the pod |

### Port

| Variable   | Description                     |
|------------|---------------------------------|
| type.port  | `true`                          |
| name       | container port name             |
| port       | port number                     |
| pod.name   | name of the owning pod          |
| pod.labels | map of labels of the owning pod |
| protocol   | "TCP" or "UDP"                  |

## Example

```yaml
extensions:
  # Configures the Kubernetes observer to watch for pod start and stop events.
  k8s_observer:

receivers:
  receiver_creator/1:
    # Name of the extensions to watch for endpoints to start and stop.
    watch_observers: [k8s_observer]
    receivers:
        redis/1:
          # If this rule matches an instance of this receiver will be started.
          rule: type.port && port == 6379
          config:
            # Static receiver-specific config.
            password: secret
            # Dynamic configuration value.
            service_name: `pod.labels["service_name"]`
