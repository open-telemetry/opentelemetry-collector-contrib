<!-- end autogenerated section -->

This receiver can instantiate other receivers at runtime based on whether
observed endpoints match a configured rule. To use the receiver creator, you
must first configure one or more
[observers](../../extension/observer/README.md) that will discover networked
endpoints that you may be interested in. The configured rules will be
evaluated for each endpoint discovered. If the rule evaluates to true then
the receiver for that rule will be started against the matched endpoint.

If you use the receiver creator in multiple pipelines of differing telemetry types,
but a given dynamically instantiated receiver doesn't support one of the pipeline's type,
it will effectively lead to a logged no-op that won't cause a collector service failure.

## Configuration

**watch_observers**

A list of observers previously defined to be run in the `extensions` section.
receiver_creator will watch for endpoints generated by these observers.

**receivers**

A map of receiver names (e.g. `redis/1`) to a template for when and how to
instantiate that receiver.

**receivers.&lt;receiver_type/id&gt;.rule**

Rule expression using [expvar
syntax](https://github.com/antonmedv/expr/blob/master/docs/Language-Definition.md).
Variables available are detailed below in [Rule
Expressions](#rule-expressions).

**receivers.&lt;receiver_type/id&gt;.config**

This is configuration that will be used when creating the receiver at
runtime.

This option can use static and dynamic configuration values. Static values
are normal YAML values. However, the value can also be dynamically constructed
from the discovered endpoint object. Dynamic values are surrounded by
backticks (\`). If a literal backtick is needed use \\` to escape it. Dynamic
values can be used with static values in which case they are concatenated.
For example:

```yaml
config:
   secure_url: https://`pod.labels["secure_host"]`
```

The value of `secure_url` will be `https://` concatenated with the value of
the `secure_host` label.

This can also be used when the discovered endpoint needs to be changed
dynamically. For instance, suppose the IP `1.2.3.4` is discovered without a
port but the port needs to be set inside endpoint. You could do:

```yaml
config:
   endpoint: '`endpoint`:8080'
```

If your target receiver provides an `endpoint` config field and you aren't
manually setting it like the above example, the observer endpoint target value
will automatically be sourced. If no `endpoint` field is available you are
required to specify any necessary fields.

**receivers.resource_attributes**

```yaml
resource_attributes:
  <endpoint type>:
    <attribute>: <attribute value>
```

This setting controls what resource attributes are set on telemetry emitted from the created receiver. These attributes can be set from [values in the endpoint](#rule-expressions) that was matched by the `rule`. These attributes vary based on the endpoint type. These defaults can be disabled by setting the attribute to be removed to an empty value. Note that the values can be dynamic and processed the same as in `config`.

Note that the backticks below are not typos--they indicate the value is set dynamically.

`type == "pod"`

| Resource Attribute | Default       |
|--------------------|---------------|
| k8s.pod.name       | \`name\`      |
| k8s.pod.uid        | \`uid\`       |
| k8s.namespace.name | \`namespace\` |

`type == "port"`

| Resource Attribute | Default           |
|--------------------|-------------------|
| k8s.pod.name       | \`pod.name\`      |
| k8s.pod.uid        | \`pod.uid\`       |
| k8s.namespace.name | \`pod.namespace\` |

`type == "container"`

| Resource Attribute   | Default           |
|----------------------|-------------------|
| container.name       | \`name\`          |
| container.image.name | \`image\`         |

`type == "hostport"`

None

`type == "k8s.node"`

| Resource Attribute | Default           |
|--------------------|-------------------|
| k8s.node.name      | \`name\`          |
| k8s.node.uid       | \`uid\`           |

See `redis/2` in [examples](#examples).


**receivers.&lt;receiver_type/id&gt;.resource_attributes**

```yaml
receivers:
  <receiver_type>:
    resource_attributes:
      <attribute>: <attribute string value>
```

Similar to the per-endpoint type `resource_attributes` described above but for individual receiver instances. Duplicate attribute entries (including the empty string) in this receiver-specific mapping take precedence. These attribute values also support expansion from endpoint environment content. At this time their values must be strings.

## Rule Expressions

Each rule must start with `type == ("pod"|"port"|"hostport"|"container"|"k8s.node") &&` such that the rule matches
only one endpoint type. Depending on the type of endpoint the rule is
targeting it will have different variables available.
