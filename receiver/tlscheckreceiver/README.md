Emit metrics about x.509 certificates.

## Getting Started

By default, the TLS Check Receiver will emit a single metric, `tlscheck.time_left`, per target. This is measured in seconds until the date and time specified in the `NotAfter` field of the x.509 certificate. After certificate expiration, the metric value will be a negative integer measuring the time in seconds since expiry.

## Example Configuration

Targets are configured as either remote enpoints accessed via TCP, or PEM-encoded certificate files stored locally on disk.

```yaml
receivers:
  tlscheck:
    targets:
      # Monitor a local PEM file
      - file_path: /etc/istio/certs/cert-chain.pem
      
      # Monitor a remote endpoint
      - endpoint: example.com:443
      
      # Monitor a local service with a custom timeout
      - endpoint: localhost:10901
        dialer: 
          timeout: 15s
```

## Certificate Verification

This component does not provide hostname, validity period, path, or CRL / OCSP verification on the certificate.

## Metrics

Details about the metrics produced by this receiver can be found in [metadata.yaml](./metadata.yaml).
