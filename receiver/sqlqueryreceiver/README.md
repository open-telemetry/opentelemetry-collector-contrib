The SQL Query Receiver uses custom SQL queries to generate metrics from a database connection.

> :construction: This receiver is in **ALPHA**. Behavior, configuration fields, and metric data model are subject to
> change.

## Configuration

The configuration supports the following top-level fields:

- `driver`(required): The name of the database driver: one of _postgres_, _mysql_, _snowflake_, _sqlserver_, _hdb_ (SAP
  HANA), or _oracle_ (Oracle DB).
- `datasource`(required): The datasource value passed to [sql.Open](https://pkg.go.dev/database/sql#Open). This is
  a driver-specific string usually consisting of at least a database name and connection information. This is sometimes
  referred to as the "connection string" in driver documentation.
  e.g. _host=localhost port=5432 user=me password=s3cr3t sslmode=disable_
- `queries`(required): A list of queries, where a query is a sql statement and one or more metrics (details below).
- `collection_interval`(optional): The time interval between query executions. Defaults to _10s_.

### Queries

A _query_ consists of a sql statement and one or more _metrics_, where each metric consists of a
`metric_name`, a `value_column`, and additional optional fields.
Each _metric_ in the configuration will produce one OTel metric per row returned from its sql query.

* `metric_name`(required): the name assigned to the OTel metric.
* `value_column`(required): the column name in the returned dataset used to set the value of the metric's datapoint.
  This may be case-sensitive, depending on the driver (e.g. Oracle DB).
* `attribute_columns`(optional): a list of column names in the returned dataset used to set attibutes on the datapoint.
  These attributes may be case-sensitive, depending on the driver (e.g. Oracle DB).
* `data_type` (optional): can be `gauge` or `sum`; defaults to `gauge`.
* `value_type` (optional): can be `int` or `double`; defaults to `int`.
* `monotonic` (optional): boolean; whether a cumulative sum's value is monotonically increasing (i.e. never rolls over
  or resets); defaults to false.
* `aggregation` (optional): only applicable for `data_type=sum`; can be `cumulative` or `delta`; defaults
  to `cumulative`.
* `description` (optional): the description applied to the metric.
* `unit` (optional): the units applied to the metric.
* `static_attributes` (optional): static attributes applied to the metrics

### Example

```yaml
receivers:
  sqlquery:
    driver: postgres
    datasource: "host=localhost port=5432 user=postgres password=s3cr3t sslmode=disable"
    queries:
      - sql: "select count(*) as count, genre from movie group by genre"
        metrics:
          - metric_name: movie.genres
            value_column: "count"
            attribute_columns: [ "genre" ]
            static_attributes:
              dbinstance: mydbinstance
```

Given a `movie` table with three rows:

| name      | genre  |
|-----------|--------|
| E.T.      | sci-fi |
| Star Wars | sci-fi |
| Die Hard  | action |

If there are two rows returned from the query `select count(*) as count, genre from movie group by genre`:

| count | genre  |
|-------|--------|
| 2     | sci-fi |
| 1     | action |

then the above config will produce two metrics at each collection interval:

```
Metric #0
Descriptor:
     -> Name: movie.genres
     -> DataType: Gauge
NumberDataPoints #0
Data point attributes:
     -> genre: STRING(sci-fi)
     -> dbinstance: STRING(mydbinstance)     
Value: 2

Metric #1
Descriptor:
     -> Name: movie.genres
     -> DataType: Gauge
NumberDataPoints #0
Data point attributes:
     -> genre: STRING(action)
     -> dbinstance: STRING(mydbinstance)
Value: 1
```

#### NULL values

Avoid queries that produce any NULL values. If a query produces a NULL value, a warning will be logged. Furthermore,
if a configuration references the column that produces a NULL value, an additional error will be logged. However, in
either case, the receiver will continue to operate.

#### Oracle DB Driver Example

Refer to the config file [provided](./testdata/oracledb-receiver-config.yaml) for an example of using the
Oracle DB driver to connect and query the same table schema and contents as the example above.
The Oracle DB driver documentation can be found [here.](https://github.com/sijms/go-ora)
Another usage example is the `go_ora`
example [here.](https://blogs.oracle.com/developers/post/connecting-a-go-application-to-oracle-database)
