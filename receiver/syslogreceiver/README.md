| `retry_on_failure.max_elapsed_time` | `5 minutes`  | Maximum amount of time (including retries) spent trying to send a logs batch to a downstream consumer. Once this value is reached, the data is discarded. Retrying never stops if set to `0`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

### Operators

Each operator performs a simple responsibility, such as parsing a timestamp or JSON. Chain together operators to process logs into a desired format.

- Every operator has a `type`.
- Every operator can be given a unique `id`. If you use the same type of operator more than once in a pipeline, you must specify an `id`. Otherwise, the `id` defaults to the value of `type`.
- Operators will output to the next operator in the pipeline. The last operator in the pipeline will emit from the receiver. Optionally, the `output` parameter can be used to specify the `id` of another operator to which logs will be passed directly.
- Only parsers and general purpose operators should be used.

| `listen_address`                | required | A listen address of the form `<ip>:<port>`.                                                                                       |

#### TLS Configuration

The `tcp_input` operator supports TLS, disabled by default.

| Field            | Default | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|------------------|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `cert_file`      |         | Path to the TLS cert to use for TLS required connections.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `key_file`       |         | Path to the TLS key to use for TLS required connections.                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `ca_file`        |         | Path to the CA cert. For a client this verifies the server certificate. For a server this verifies client certificates. If empty, the system root CA is used.                                                                                         |
| `client_ca_file` |         | (optional) Path to the TLS cert to use by the server to verify a client certificate. This sets the ClientCAs and ClientAuth to RequireAndVerifyClientCert in the TLSConfig. Please refer to godoc.org/crypto/tls#Config for more information. |

#### `multiline` configuration

If set, the `multiline` configuration block instructs the `udp_input` operator to split log entries on a pattern other than newlines.

**note** If `multiline` is not set at all, it won't split log entries at all. Every UDP packet is going to be treated as a log.
**note** `multiline` detection works per UDP packet due to protocol limitations.

The `multiline` configuration block must contain exactly one of `line_start_pattern` or `line_end_pattern`. These are regex patterns that
match either the beginning of a new log entry, or the end of a log entry.

The `omit_pattern` setting can be used to omit the start/end pattern from each entry.

#### Supported encodings

| Key        | Description                                                      |
|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `nop`      | No encoding validation. Treats the file as a stream of raw bytes |
| `utf-8`    | UTF-8 encoding                                                   |
| `utf-16le` | UTF-16 encoding with little-endian byte order                    |
| `utf-16be` | UTF-16 encoding with big-endian byte order                    |
| `ascii`    | ASCII encoding                                                   |
| `big5`     | The Big5 Chinese character encoding                              |

Other less common encodings are supported on a best-effort basis.
See [https://www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets/character-sets.xhtml](https://www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets/character-sets.xhtml)
for other encodings available.

#### `async` configuration

If set, the `async` configuration block instructs the `udp_input` operator to read and process logs asynchronously and concurrently.

**note** If `async` is not set at all, a single thread will read & process lines synchronously.

| Field              | Default | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|--------------------|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `readers`          | 1       | Concurrency level - Determines how many go routines read from UDP port and push to channel (to be handled by processors).                                                                                                                           |
| `processors`       | 1       | Concurrency level - Determines how many go routines read from channel (pushed by readers) and process logs before sending downstream.                                                                                                               |
| `max_queue_length` | 100     | Determines max number of messages which may be waiting for a processor. While the queue is full, the readers will wait until there's room (readers will not drop messages, but they will not read additional incoming messages during that period). |

## Additional Terminology and Features

- An [entry](../../pkg/stanza/docs/types/entry.md) is the base representation of log data as it moves through a pipeline. All operators either create, modify, or consume entries.
- A [field](../../pkg/stanza/docs/types/field.md) is used to reference values in an entry.
- A common [expression](../../pkg/stanza/docs/types/expression.md) syntax is used in several operators. For example, expressions can be used to [filter](../../pkg/stanza/docs/operators/filter.md) or [route](../../pkg/stanza/docs/operators/router.md) entries.

### Parsers with Embedded Operations

Many parsers operators can be configured to embed certain followup operations such as timestamp and severity parsing. For more information, see [complex parsers](../../pkg/stanza/docs/types/parsers.md#complex-parsers).

## Example Configurations
