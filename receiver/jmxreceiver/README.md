### Overview

The JMX Receiver will work in conjunction with the [OpenTelemetry JMX Metric Gatherer](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-contrib/blob/main/jmx-metrics/README.md) (built-in `otel` helper-utilizing Groovy script) or the [OpenTelemetry JMX Scraper](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-contrib/tree/main/jmx-scraper) (YAML metrics mapping) to report metrics from a target MBean server.

### Details

This receiver will launch a child JRE process running the corresponding JAR (JMX Metric Gatherer or JMX Scraper) configured with your specified JMX
connection information. It then reports metrics to an implicitly created OTLP receiver.
In order to use you will need to download the most [recent release](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-contrib/releases)
of the JMX JAR and configure the receiver with its path. It is assumed that the JRE is
available on your system.

# Configuration

Example configuration:

```yaml
receivers:
  jmx:
    jar_path: /opt/opentelemetry-java-contrib-jmx-metrics.jar
    endpoint: my_jmx_host:12345
    target_system: jvm
    collection_interval: 10s
    initial_delay: 1s
    # optional: the same as specifying OTLP receiver endpoint.
    otlp:
      endpoint: mycollectorotlpreceiver:4317
    username: my_jmx_username
    # determined by the environment variable value
    password: ${env:MY_JMX_PASSWORD}
    resource_attributes:
      my.attr: my.value
      my.other.attr: my.other.value
    log_level: info
    additional_jars:
      - /path/to/other.jar
```

### jar_path (default: `/opt/opentelemetry-java-contrib-jmx-metrics.jar`)

**Supported by:** `jmx-scraper`, `jmx-gatherer`

The path for the JMX JAR (JMX Metric Gatherer or JMX Scraper) to run. This must represent a released version 1.9+ of the jar,
which can be downloaded from [github](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-contrib/releases).
If a non-released version is required, you can specify a custom version by providing the sha256 hash of your
custom version of the jar during collector build time using the `ldflags` option.

For the JMX Metric Gatherer:

```bash
go build -ldflags "-X github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/receiver/jmxreceiver.MetricsGathererHash=<sha256hash>" ...
```

Custom JMX Scraper:

```bash
go build -ldflags "-X github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/receiver/jmxreceiver.ScraperHash=<sha256hash>" ...
```

### endpoint

**Supported by:** `jmx-scraper`, `jmx-gatherer`

The [JMX Service URL](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/management/remote/JMXServiceURL.html) or host
and port used to construct the Service URL the JMX client should use. Value must be in the form of
`service:jmx:<protocol>:<sap>` or `host:port`. Values in `host:port` form will be used to create a Service URL of
`service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://<host>:<port>/jmxrmi`.

When in or coerced to `service:jmx:<protocol>:<sap>` form, corresponds to the `otel.jmx.service.url` property.

_Required._

### target_system

**Supported by:** `jmx-scraper`, `jmx-gatherer`

The built-in target system (or systems) metric gatherer to run. Supported
targets include:

 - [JMX Scraper documentation](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-contrib/tree/main/jmx-scraper#configuration-reference)
 - [JMX Gatherer documentation](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-contrib/tree/main/jmx-metrics#target-systems)

If additional target systems must be supported (because of a custom jar configured using the
`MetricsGathererHash` build time config), they can be added with another build time flag.

```bash
go build -ldflags "-X github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/receiver/jmxreceiver.MetricsGathererHash=<sha256hash>
       -X github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/receiver/jmxreceiver.AdditionalTargetSystems=newtarget,othernewtarget" ...
```

Corresponds to the `otel.jmx.target.system` property.

### target_source

**Supported by:** `jmx-scraper`
