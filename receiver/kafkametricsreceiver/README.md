Kafka metrics receiver collects kafka metrics (brokers, topics, partitions, consumer groups) from kafka server,
converting into otlp.

## Prerequisites

This receiver supports Kafka versions:
  -  2.X
  -  3.X

## Getting Started

Required settings (no defaults):

- `protocol_version`: Kafka protocol version
- `scrapers`: any combination of the following scrapers can be enabled.
    - `topics`
    - `consumers`
    - `brokers`
    
Metrics collected by the associated scraper are listed [here](metadata.yaml)

Optional Settings (with defaults):

- `cluster_alias`: Alias name of the cluster. Adds `kafka.cluster.alias` resource attribute.
- `brokers` (default = localhost:9092): the list of brokers to read from.
- `resolve_canonical_bootstrap_servers_only` (default = false): whether to resolve then reverse-lookup broker IPs during startup.
- `topic_match` (default = ^[^_].*$): regex pattern of topics to filter on metrics collection. The default filter excludes internal topics (starting with `_`).
- `group_match` (default = .*): regex pattern of consumer groups to filter on for metrics.
- `client_id` (default = otel-metrics-receiver): consumer client id
- `collection_interval` (default = 1m): frequency of metric collection/scraping.
- `initial_delay` (default = `1s`): defines how long this receiver waits before starting.
- `auth` (default none)
    - `plain_text`
        - `username`: The username to use.
        - `password`: The password to use
    - `tls`
        - `ca_file`: path to the CA cert. For a client this verifies the server certificate. Should only be used
          if `insecure` is set to true.
        - `cert_file`: path to the TLS cert to use for TLS required connections. Should only be used if `insecure` is
          set to true.
        - `key_file`: path to the TLS key to use for TLS required connections. Should only be used if `insecure` is set
          to true.
        - `insecure` (default = false): Disable verifying the server's certificate chain and host
          name (`InsecureSkipVerify` in the tls config)
        - `server_name_override`: ServerName indicates the name of the server requested by the client in order to
          support virtual hosting.
    - `kerberos`
        - `service_name`: Kerberos service name
        - `realm`: Kerberos realm
        - `use_keytab`:  Use of keytab instead of password, if this is true, keytab file will be used instead of
          password
        - `username`: The Kerberos username used for authenticate with KDC
        - `password`: The Kerberos password used for authenticate with KDC
        - `config_file`: Path to Kerberos configuration. i.e /etc/krb5.conf
        - `keytab_file`: Path to keytab file. i.e /etc/security/kafka.keytab
        - `disable_fast_negotiation`: Disable PA-FX-FAST negotiation (Pre-Authentication Framework - Fast). Some common Kerberos implementations do not support PA-FX-FAST negotiation. This is set to `false` by default.

## Examples:

1) Basic configuration with all scrapers:

```yaml
receivers:
  kafkametrics:
    protocol_version: 2.0.0
    scrapers:
      - brokers
      - topics
      - consumers
```

2) Configuration with more optional settings:

For this example:
- collection interval is 5 secs.

```yaml
receivers:
  kafkametrics:
    cluster_alias: kafka-prod
    brokers: 10.10.10.10:9092
    protocol_version: 2.0.0
    scrapers:
      - brokers
      - topics
      - consumers
    auth:
      tls:
        ca_file: ca.pem
        cert_file: cert.pem
        key_file: key.pem
    collection_interval: 5s
```
