        The receiver uses the Google Cloud Pub/Sub StreamingPull API and keeps a open connection. The Pub/Sub servers
        recurrently close the connection after a time period to avoid a long-running sticky connection. This metric
        counts the number of the resets that occurred during the lifetime of the container.
