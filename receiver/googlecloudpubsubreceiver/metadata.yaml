        The receiver uses the Google Cloud Pub/Sub StreamingPull API and keeps a open connection. The Pub/Sub servers
        recurrently close the connection after a time period to avoid a long-running sticky connection. This metric
        counts the number of the resets that occurred during the lifetime of the container.
    receiver.googlecloudpubsub.encoding_error:
      enabled: true
      description: Number of times a message couldn't be decoded by the configured encoder
      unit: "1"
      sum:
        value_type: int
        monotonic: true
      extended_documentation: |
        The receiver reads messages from Google Cloud Pub/Sub and tries to decode the message using the configured
        encoder. Each time a message fails to decoded the counter is increased.
