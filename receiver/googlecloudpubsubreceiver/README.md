> ⚠️ This is a community-provided module. It has been developed and extensively tested at Collibra, but it is not officially supported by GCP.
 
This receiver gets OTLP messages from a Google Cloud [Pubsub](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub) subscription.

The following configuration options are supported:

* `project` (Optional): The Google Cloud Project of the client connects to.
* `subscription` (Required): The subscription name to receive OTLP data from. The subscription name should be a
  fully qualified resource name (eg: `projects/otel-project/subscriptions/otlp`).
* `encoding` (Optional): The encoding that will be used to received data from the subscription. This can either be
  `otlp_proto_trace`, `otlp_proto_metric`, `otlp_proto_log`, `cloud_logging`, or `raw_text` (see `encoding`).  This will
  only be used as a fallback, when no `content-type` attribute is present.
* `compression` (Optional): The compression that will be used on received data from the subscription. When set it can 
  only be `gzip`. This will only be used as a fallback, when no `content-encoding` attribute is present.
* `endpoint` (Optional): Override the default Pubsub Endpoint, useful when connecting to the PubSub emulator instance
  or switching between [global and regional service endpoints](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/reference/service_apis_overview#service_endpoints).
* `insecure` (Optional): allows performing “insecure” SSL connections and transfers, useful when connecting to a local
   emulator instance. Only has effect if Endpoint is not ""
* `ignore_encoding_error` (Optional): Ignore errors when the configured encoder fails to decoding a PubSub messages.
  It's advised to set this to `true` when using a custom encoder, and use `receiver.googlecloudpubsub.encoding_error`
  metric to monitor the number of errors. Ignoring the error will cause the receiver to drop the message.

```yaml
receivers:
  googlecloudpubsub:
    project: otel-project
    subscription: projects/otel-project/subscriptions/otlp-logs
    encoding: raw_json
```

## Encoding

The `encoding` options allows you to specify Encoding Extensions for decoding messages on the subscription. An
extension need to be configured in the `extensions` section, and added to pipeline in the collectors configuration file.

The following example shows how to use the text encoding extension for ingesting arbitrary text message on a 
subscription, wrapping them in OTLP Log messages. Note that not all extensions support all signals.

```yaml
extensions:
  text_encoding:
    encoding: utf8
    unmarshaling_separator: "\r?\n"

service:
  extensions: [text_encoding]
  pipelines:
    logs:
      receivers: [googlecloudpubsub]
      processors: []
      exporters: [debug]
```

The receiver also supports build in encodings for the native OTLP encodings, without the need to specify an Encoding 
Extensions. The non OTLP build in encodings will be deprecated as soon as extensions for the formats are available.

| encoding          | description                                    |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| otlp_proto_trace  | Decode OTLP trace message                      |
| otlp_proto_metric | Decode OTLP trace message                      |
| otlp_proto_log    | Decode OTLP trace message                      |
| cloud_logging     | Decode [Cloud Logging] [LogEntry] message type |
| raw_text          | Wrap in an OTLP log message                    |

With `cloud_logging`, the receiver can be used to bring Cloud Logging messages into an OpenTelemetry pipeline. You'll
first need to [set up a logging sink][sink-docs] with a Pub/Sub topic as its destination. The build-in encoding is
**deprecated** and will be removed in v0.132.0: Use the `googlecloudlogentry` encoding extension instead.

With `raw_text`, the receiver can be used for ingesting arbitrary text message on a Pubsub subscription, wrapping them
in OTLP Log messages.  The build-in encoding is **deprecated** and will be removed in v0.132.0: Use the `text` encoding
extension instead.

When no encoding is specified, the receiver will try to discover the type of the data by looking at the `ce-type` and
`content-type` attributes of the message. These message attributes are set by the `googlepubsubexporter`.

| ce-type                           | ce-datacontenttype   | encoding          | description                                    |
|-----------------------------------|----------------------|-------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| org.opentelemetry.otlp.traces.v1  | application/protobuf |                   | Decode OTLP trace message                      |
| org.opentelemetry.otlp.metrics.v1 | application/protobuf |                   | Decode OTLP metric message                     |
| org.opentelemetry.otlp.logs.v1    | application/protobuf |                   | Decode OTLP log message                        |

## Pubsub subscription

The Google Cloud [Pubsub](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub) receiver doesn't automatically create subscriptions, 
it expects the subscription to be created upfront. Security wise it's best to give the collector its own 
service account and give the subscription `Pub/Sub Subscriber` permission.

The subscription should also be of delivery type `Pull`.

### Filtering

When the messages on the subscription are accompanied by the correct attributes and you only need a specific
type in your pipeline, the messages can be [filtered](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/filtering) on the 
subscription saving on egress fees.

An example of filtering on trace message only: 
```
attributes.ce-type = "org.opentelemetry.otlp.traces.v1"
AND
attributes.content-type = "application/protobuf"
```
