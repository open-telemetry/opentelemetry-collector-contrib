> ⚠️ This is a community-provided module. It has been developed and extensively tested at Collibra, but it is not officially supported by GCP.
 
This receiver gets OTLP messages from a Google Cloud [Pubsub](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub) subscription.

The following configuration options are supported:

* `project` (Optional): The Google Cloud Project of the client connects to.
* `subscription` (Required): The subscription name to receive OTLP data from. The subscription name should be a
  fully qualified resource name (eg: `projects/otel-project/subscriptions/otlp`).
* `encoding` (Optional): The encoding that will be used to received data from the subscription. This can either be
  `otlp_proto_trace`, `otlp_proto_metric`, `otlp_proto_log`, `cloud_logging`, or `raw_text` (see `encoding`).  This will
  only be used as a fallback, when no `content-type` attribute is present.
* `compression` (Optional): The compression that will be used on received data from the subscription. When set it can 
  only be `gzip`. This will only be used as a fallback, when no `content-encoding` attribute is present.
* `endpoint` (Optional): Override the default Pubsub Endpoint, useful when connecting to the PubSub emulator instance
  or switching between [global and regional service endpoints](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/reference/service_apis_overview#service_endpoints).
* `insecure` (Optional): allows performing “insecure” SSL connections and transfers, useful when connecting to a local
   emulator instance. Only has effect if Endpoint is not ""

```yaml
receivers:
  googlecloudpubsub:
    project: otel-project
    subscription: projects/otel-project/subscriptions/otlp-logs
    encoding: raw_json
```

## Encoding

You should not need to set the encoding of the subscription as the receiver will try to discover the type of the data
by looking at the `ce-type` and `content-type` attributes of the message. Only when those attributes are not set 
must the `encoding` field in the configuration be set. 

| ce-type                           | ce-datacontenttype   | encoding          | description                                    |
|-----------------------------------|----------------------|-------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| org.opentelemetry.otlp.traces.v1  | application/protobuf |                   | Decode OTLP trace message                      |
| org.opentelemetry.otlp.metrics.v1 | application/protobuf |                   | Decode OTLP metric message                     |
| org.opentelemetry.otlp.logs.v1    | application/json     |                   | Decode OTLP log message                        |
| -                                 | -                    | otlp_proto_trace  | Decode OTLP trace message                      |
| -                                 | -                    | otlp_proto_metric | Decode OTLP trace message                      |
| -                                 | -                    | otlp_proto_log    | Decode OTLP trace message                      |
| -                                 | -                    | cloud_logging     | Decode [Cloud Logging] [LogEntry] message type |
| -                                 | -                    | raw_text          | Wrap in an OTLP log message                    |

When the `encoding` configuration is set, the attributes on the message are ignored.

With `cloud_logging`, the receiver can be used to bring Cloud Logging messages into an OpenTelemetry pipeline. You'll
first need to [set up a logging sink][sink-docs] with a Pub/Sub topic as its destination. Note that the `cloud_logging`
integration is considered **alpha** as the semantic convention on some of the conversion are not stabilized yet.

With `raw_text`, the receiver can be used for ingesting arbitrary text message on a Pubsub subscription, wrapping them
in OTLP Log messages, making it a convenient way to ingest raw log lines from Pubsub.

## Pubsub subscription

The Google Cloud [Pubsub](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub) receiver doesn't automatically create subscriptions, 
it expects the subscription to be created upfront. Security wise it's best to give the collector its own 
service account and give the subscription `Pub/Sub Subscriber` permission.

The subscription should also be of delivery type `Pull`.

### Filtering

When the messages on the subscription are accompanied by the correct attributes and you only need a specific
type in your pipeline, the messages can be [filtered](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/filtering) on the 
subscription saving on egress fees.

An example of filtering on trace message only: 
```
attributes.ce-type = "org.opentelemetry.otlp.traces.v1"
AND
attributes.content-type = "application/protobuf"
```
