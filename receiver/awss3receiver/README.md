### Time format for `starttime` and `endtime`
The `starttime` and `endtime` fields are used to specify the time range for which to retrieve data. 
The time format is either RFC3339,`YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM` or simply `YYYY-MM-DD`, in which case the time is assumed to be `00:00`.

### Encodings
By default, the receiver understands the following encodings:
- otlp_json (OpenTelemetry Protocol format represented as json) with a suffix of `.json`
- otlp_proto (OpenTelemetry Protocol format represented as Protocol Buffers) with a suffix of `.binpb`

The `encodings` options allows you to specify Encoding Extensions to use to decode keys with matching suffixes. 


### Example Configuration

```yaml
extension:
  # example of text encoding extension
  text_encoding:
    encoding: utf8
    marshaling_separator: "\n"
    unmarshaling_separator: "\r?\n"
    
receivers:
  awss3:
    starttime: "2024-01-01 01:00"
    endtime: "2024-01-02"
    s3downloader:
        region: "us-west-1"
        s3_bucket: "mybucket"
        s3_prefix: "trace"
        s3_partition: "minute"
    encodings:
      - extension: text_encoding
        suffix: ".txt"
```

## Notifications
The receiver can send notifications of ingest progress to an OpAmp server using the custom message capability of 
"org.opentelemetry.collector.receiver.awss3" and message type "TimeBasedIngestStatus".
The format of the notifications is a ProtoBuf formatted OLTP logs message with a single Log Record. The `body` of the 
record is set to `status` and the timestamp of the record is used to hold the ingest time. The record also has the 
following attributes:

| Attribute         | Description                                                                     |
|:------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `telemetry_type`  | The type of telemetry being ingested. One of "traces", "metrics", or "logs".    |
| `ingest_status`   | The status of the data ingestion. One of "ingesting", "failed", or "completed". |
| `start_time`      | The time to start retrieving data as an Int64, nanoseconds since Unix epoch.    |
| `end_time`        | The time to stop retrieving data as an Int64, nanoseconds since Unix epoch.     |
| `failure_message` | Error message if `ingest_status` is "failed".                                   |

The "ingesting" status is sent at the beginning of the ingest process before data has been retrieved for the specified time.
If during the processing of the data an error occurs a status message with `ingest_status` set to "failed" status with 
the time of the data being ingested when the failure occurred.
If the ingest process completes successfully a status message with `ingest_status` set to "completed" is sent.
