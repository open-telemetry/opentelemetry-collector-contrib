The `sqlserver` receiver grabs metrics about a Microsoft SQL Server instance. The receiver works by either using the
Windows Performance Counters, or by directly connecting to the instance and querying it. Windows Performance Counters
are only available when running on Windows.

Make sure to run the collector as administrator in order to collect all performance counters for metrics. 

## Configuration

The following settings are optional:
- `collection_interval` (default = `10s`): The interval at which metrics should be emitted by this receiver.
- `instance_name` (optional): The instance name identifies the specific SQL Server instance being monitored.
  If unspecified, metrics will be scraped from all instances. If configured, the `computer_name` must also be set
  when running on Windows.

Direct connection options (optional, but all must be specified to enable):
- `username`: The username used to connect to the SQL Server instance.
- `password`: The password used to connect to the SQL Server instance.
- `server`: IP Address or hostname of SQL Server instance to connect to.
- `port`: Port of the SQL Server instance to connect to.

Windows-specific options:
- `computer_name` (optional): The computer name identifies the SQL Server name or IP address of the computer being monitored.
  If specified, `instance_name` is also required to be defined. This option is ignored in non-Windows environments.

Example:

```yaml
    receivers:
      sqlserver:
        collection_interval: 10s
      sqlserver/1:
        collection_interval: 5s
        username: sa
        password: securepassword
        server: 0.0.0.0
        port: 1433
```

When a named instance is used on Windows, a computer name and a instance name must be specified.
Example with named instance:

```yaml
    receivers:
      sqlserver:
        collection_interval: 10s
        computer_name: CustomServer
        instance_name: CustomInstance
        resource_attributes:
          sqlserver.computer.name:
            enabled: true
          sqlserver.instance.name:
            enabled: true
```

The full list of settings exposed for this receiver are documented in [config.go](./config.go) with detailed sample configurations [here](./testdata/config.yaml).

## Metrics

Details about the metrics produced by this receiver can be found in [documentation.md](./documentation.md)
