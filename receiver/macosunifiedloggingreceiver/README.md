The macOS Unified Logging Receiver collects logs from macOS systems using the native `log` command. This receiver supports both live system logs and archived log files (`.logarchive`).

## Requirements

- macOS 10.12 (Sierra) or later
- The `log` command must be available in PATH
- For archive mode: Read access to the `.logarchive` directory
- For live mode: Appropriate permissions to read system logs

## Configuration

### Configuration Options

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `archive_path` | string | "" | Path or glob pattern to `.logarchive` directory(ies). If empty, reads live system logs. Supports glob patterns (e.g., `*.logarchive`, `**/logs/*.logarchive`) which will match multiple archives |
| `predicate` | string | "" | Filter predicate (e.g., `"subsystem == 'com.apple.example'"`) |
| `start_time` | string | "" | Start time in format "2006-01-02 15:04:05" |
| `end_time` | string | "" | End time in format "2006-01-02 15:04:05" (archive mode only) |
| `max_poll_interval` | duration | 30s | Maximum interval between polling for new logs (live mode only). Uses exponential backoff starting at 100ms |
| `max_log_age` | duration | 24h | Maximum age of logs to read on startup (live mode only) |
| `format` | string | "default" | Output format: `default`, `ndjson`, `json`, `syslog`, or `compact` |

### Exponential Backoff Behavior

In live mode, the receiver uses exponential backoff to optimize polling based on log activity:

- **Active Logging**: When logs are actively being written, the receiver polls frequently (starting at 100ms) to minimize latency and catch logs written immediately after the previous poll
- **Idle Period**: When no logs are found, the polling interval increases exponentially (doubling each time) up to `max_poll_interval`
- **Automatic Reset**: As soon as logs are detected again, the interval resets to the minimum (100ms)

This approach minimizes both latency during active logging and resource usage during idle periods.

### Basic Configuration (Live Mode)

```yaml
receivers:
  macosunifiedlogging:
    max_poll_interval: 30s  # Maximum interval between polls (uses exponential backoff)
    max_log_age: 24h        # How far back to read on startup
```

### Archive Mode (Single Archive)

```yaml
receivers:
  macosunifiedlogging:
    archive_path: "/path/to/system_logs.logarchive"
    start_time: "2024-01-01 00:00:00"
    end_time: "2024-01-02 00:00:00"
```

### Archive Mode (Glob Pattern - Multiple Archives)

```yaml
receivers:
  macosunifiedlogging:
    archive_path: "/logs/**/*.logarchive"  # Matches all .logarchive directories recursively
    format: "ndjson"
```


### With Filtering

```yaml
receivers:
  macosunifiedlogging:
    archive_path: "./logs.logarchive"
    predicate: "subsystem == 'com.apple.systempreferences'"
```

### With Custom Format

```yaml
receivers:
  macosunifiedlogging:
    format: ndjson             # Use structured JSON output
    max_poll_interval: 30s
    max_log_age: 24h
```


## Predicate Examples

Filter by subsystem:
```
subsystem == 'com.apple.systempreferences'
```

Filter by process:
```
process == 'kernel'
```

Filter by message type:
```
messageType == 'Error'
```

Combine filters:
```
subsystem == 'com.apple.example' AND messageType IN {'Error', 'Fault'}
```

For a full description of predicate expressions, run `log help predicates`.

### Security Note

Predicate values are validated to ensure only valid predicate syntax is used. The following are not allowed:
- Command separators: `;`
- Pipes: `|` (`||` are normalized to `OR`)
- Variable expansion: `$`
- Backticks: `` ` ``
- Redirects: `>>`, `<<`
- Control characters: newlines, carriage returns

Valid predicate operators like `&&` (logical AND), `<`, `>` (comparison) are allowed. The `>` operator is allowed for comparisons (e.g., `processID > 100`) but blocked when followed by file paths. Note that `&&` is automatically normalized to `AND` for consistency. Use standard predicate syntax as documented by Apple's `log` command.

## Output Format

The receiver converts macOS logs to OpenTelemetry log records:

- **Body**: Contains the entire log line as a string
- **Attributes**: Not set

### Format Options

#### `ndjson` and `json` Formats

When using JSON formats, each log line is captured as a complete JSON string in the body, with timestamp and severity extracted:

- **Timestamp**: Parsed from the `timestamp` field in the JSON
- **Severity**: Mapped from `messageType` (Error, Fault, Default, Info, Debug)

#### `default`, `syslog`, and `compact` Formats

When using plain text formats, each log line is captured as plain text in the body:

- **Timestamp**: Set to observed time (when the log was received)
- **Severity**: Not set

## Example

Complete example configuration:

```yaml
receivers:
  macosunifiedlogging:
    archive_path: "./system_logs.logarchive"
    predicate: "subsystem BEGINSWITH 'com.apple'"
    start_time: "2024-01-01 00:00:00"

exporters:
  file:
    path: "./output/logs.json"
    format: json

service:
  pipelines:
    logs:
      receivers: [macosunifiedlogging]
      exporters: [file]
```
