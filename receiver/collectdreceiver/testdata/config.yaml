  # Receiver will look for query params that are prefixed with this value
  # and add them as attributes to all the metrics supplied by the request.
  # For example, if the receiver receives a request at `/post-collectd?dap_k=v`
  # and attributes_prefix is set to "dap"_, then all metrics supplied by the
  # request will have an attribute with key `k` and value `v`.

  # Which encoding format should the receiver try to decode the request with.
  # Receiver only supports JSON. This options only exists to make keep things
  # explicit and as a placeholder for any formats added in future.
