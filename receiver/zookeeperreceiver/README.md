The Zookeeper receiver collects metrics from a Zookeeper instance, using the `mntr` command. The `mntr` 4 letter word command needs
to be enabled for the receiver to be able to collect metrics.

## Configuration

- `endpoint`: (default = `localhost:2181`) Endpoint to connect to collect metrics. Takes the form `host:port`. You can temporarily disable the `component.UseLocalHostAsDefaultHost` feature gate to change this to `0.0.0.0:2181`. This feature gate will be removed in a future release.
- `timeout`: (default = `10s`) Timeout within which requests should be completed.
- `initial_delay` (default = `1s`): defines how long this receiver waits before starting.

Example configuration.

```yaml
receivers:
  zookeeper:
    endpoint: "localhost:2181"
    collection_interval: 20s
    initial_delay: 1s
```

## Metrics

Details about the metrics produced by this receiver can be found in [metadata.yaml](./metadata.yaml) with further documentation in [documentation.md](./documentation.md)

## Limitations

This receiver does not support scraping metrics from Zookeeper's [New Metric System](https://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/r3.6.3/zookeeperMonitor.html#Metrics-System).
