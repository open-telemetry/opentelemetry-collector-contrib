The HTTP Check Receiver can be used for synthethic checks against HTTP endpoints. This receiver will make a request to the specified `endpoint` using the
configured `method`. This scraper generates a metric with a label for each HTTP response status class with a value of `1` if the status code matches the
class. For example, the following metrics will be generated if the endpoint returned a `200`:

```
httpcheck.status{http.status_class:1xx, http.status_code:200,...} = 0
httpcheck.status{http.status_class:2xx, http.status_code:200,...} = 1
httpcheck.status{http.status_class:3xx, http.status_code:200,...} = 0
httpcheck.status{http.status_class:4xx, http.status_code:200,...} = 0
httpcheck.status{http.status_class:5xx, http.status_code:200,...} = 0
```

## Configuration

The following configuration settings are available:

- `targets` (required): The list of targets to be monitored.
- `collection_interval` (optional, default = `60s`): This receiver collects metrics on an interval. Valid time units are `ns`, `us` (or `µs`), `ms`, `s`, `m`, `h`.
- `initial_delay` (optional, default = `1s`): defines how long this receiver waits before starting.

Each target has the following properties:

- `endpoint` (required): the URL to be monitored
- `method` (optional, default: `GET`): The HTTP method used to call the endpoint

Additionally, each target supports the client configuration options of [confighttp].

### Example Configuration

```yaml
receivers:
  httpcheck:
    targets:
      - endpoint: http://endpoint:80
        method: GET
      - endpoint: http://localhost:8080/health
        method: GET
      - endpoint: http://localhost:8081/health
        method: POST
        headers:
          test-header: "test-value"
    collection_interval: 10s
```

## Metrics

Details about the metrics produced by this receiver can be found in [documentation.md](./documentation.md)
