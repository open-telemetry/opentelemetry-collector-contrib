Tails and parses logs in k8s environment.

There only one mode of discovery as for now, it's specified by the `discovery.mode` configuration option:
- `daemonset-stdout`: (default) Deployed as a DaemonSet, the receiver will read logs from the stdout of pods in the same node.

Two modes of discovery are planned to be supported in the future:

- `daemonset-file`: Deployed as a DaemonSet, the receiver will read logs from files inside pods in the same node.
- `sidecar`: Deployed as a sidecar container, the receiver will read logs from files.

## Configuration

The following settings are common to all discovery modes:

| Field            | Default            | Description                                                                                                      |
|------------------|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `discovery.mode` | `daemonset-stdout` | The mode of discovery. Only `daemonset-stdout` is supported now. `daemonset-file` and `sidecar` are coming soon. |
| `extract`        |                    | The rules to extract metadata from pods and containers. TODO default values.                                     |
| TODO: add fields for reading files similar to filelogreceiver |

When `discovery.mode` is not `sidecar`, there are additional configuration options:

| Field                         | Default          | Description                                                                                                                                                   |
|-------------------------------|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `discovery.k8s_api.auth_type` | `serviceAccount` | The authentication type of k8s api. Options are `serviceAccount` or `kubeConfig`.                                                                             |
| `discovery.host_root`         | `/host-root`     | The directory which the root of host is mounted on.                                                                                                           |
| `discovery.runtime_apis`      |                  | The runtime apis used to get log file paths. docker and cri-containerd are supported now. By default, it will try to automatically detect the cri-containerd. |
| `discovery.node_from_env`     | `KUBE_NODE_NAME` | The environment variable name of node name.                                                                                                                   |
| `discovery.filter`            | []               | The filter used to filter pods and containers. By default, all pods and containers will be collected.                                                         |

### Operators

Each operator performs a simple responsibility, such as parsing a timestamp or JSON. Chain together operators to process logs into a desired format.

- Every operator has a `type`.
- Every operator can be given a unique `id`. If you use the same type of operator more than once in a pipeline, you must specify an `id`. Otherwise, the `id` defaults to the value of `type`.
- Operators will output to the next operator in the pipeline. The last operator in the pipeline will emit from the receiver. Optionally, the `output` parameter can be used to specify the `id` of another operator to which logs will be passed directly.
- Only parsers and general purpose operators should be used.

### Filters

When `discovery.mode` is not `sidecar`, the `discovery.filter` field can be used to filter pods and containers. The filter is a list of rules. Each rule is a map with the following fields:

| Field         | Description                                                  |

| `env`         | MapFilters that filters containers by environment variables. |
| `containers`  | ValueFilters that filters containers by name.                |
| `namespaces`  | ValueFilters that filters pods by namespace.                 |

## Additional Terminology and Features

- An [entry](../../pkg/stanza/docs/types/entry.md) is the base representation of log data as it moves through a pipeline. All operators either create, modify, or consume entries.
- A [field](../../pkg/stanza/docs/types/field.md) is used to reference values in an entry.
- A common [expression](../../pkg/stanza/docs/types/expression.md) syntax is used in several operators. For example, expressions can be used to [filter](../../pkg/stanza/docs/operators/filter.md) or [route](../../pkg/stanza/docs/operators/router.md) entries.

### Parsers with Embedded Operations

Many parsers operators can be configured to embed certain followup operations such as timestamp and severity parsing. For more information, see [complex parsers](../../pkg/stanza/docs/types/parsers.md#complex-parsers).

## Example - Collect logs from stdout of all containers

Receiver Configuration
```yaml
receivers:
  k8slog:
    discovery:
      mode: daemonset-stdout
    operators:
      - type: recombine
        combine_field: body
        is_first_entry: body matches "^\\d{4}-\\d{2}-\\d{2}"
        max_log_size: 128kb
        source_identifier: attributes["k8s.pod.uid"]
```
