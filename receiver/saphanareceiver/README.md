This receiver can fetch stats from a SAP HANA instance. It leverages the [driver](https://github.com/SAP/go-hdb) written by SAP for connecting to SAP HANA with the golang sql module to execute several monitoring queries.

### Prerequisites

> The receiver is intended to support SAP HANA version 2, older versions have not been tested.

A monitoring user requires `SELECT` access to the relevant monitoring views. The following sql script should create a monitoring role and apply it to a monitoring user if executed by a user with sufficient permissions connected to the SAP HANA instance.

```sql
--Create the user
CREATE RESTRICTED USER otel_monitoring_user PASSWORD <password>;

--Enable user login
ALTER USER otel_monitoring_user ENABLE CLIENT CONNECT;

--Create the monitoring role
CREATE ROLE OTEL_MONITORING;

--Grant permissions to the relevant views
GRANT CATALOG READ TO OTEL_MONITORING;
GRANT SELECT ON SYS.M_BACKUP_CATALOG TO OTEL_MONITORING;
GRANT SELECT ON SYS.M_BLOCKED_TRANSACTIONS TO OTEL_MONITORING;
GRANT SELECT ON SYS.M_CONNECTIONS TO OTEL_MONITORING;
GRANT SELECT ON SYS.M_CS_ALL_COLUMNS TO OTEL_MONITORING;
GRANT SELECT ON SYS.M_CS_TABLES TO OTEL_MONITORING;
GRANT SELECT ON SYS.M_DATABASE TO OTEL_MONITORING;
GRANT SELECT ON SYS.M_DISKS TO OTEL_MONITORING;
GRANT SELECT ON SYS.M_HOST_RESOURCE_UTILIZATION TO OTEL_MONITORING;
GRANT SELECT ON SYS.M_LICENSES TO OTEL_MONITORING;
GRANT SELECT ON SYS.M_RS_TABLES TO OTEL_MONITORING;
GRANT SELECT ON SYS.M_SERVICE_COMPONENT_MEMORY TO OTEL_MONITORING;
GRANT SELECT ON SYS.M_SERVICE_MEMORY TO OTEL_MONITORING;
GRANT SELECT ON SYS.M_SERVICE_REPLICATION TO OTEL_MONITORING;
GRANT SELECT ON SYS.M_SERVICE_STATISTICS TO OTEL_MONITORING;
GRANT SELECT ON SYS.M_SERVICE_THREADS TO OTEL_MONITORING;
GRANT SELECT ON SYS.M_SERVICES TO OTEL_MONITORING;
GRANT SELECT ON SYS.M_VOLUME_IO_TOTAL_STATISTICS TO OTEL_MONITORING;
GRANT SELECT ON SYS.M_WORKLOAD TO OTEL_MONITORING;
GRANT SELECT ON _SYS_STATISTICS.STATISTICS_CURRENT_ALERTS TO OTEL_MONITORING;

--Add the OTEL_MONITOR role to the monitoring user
GRANT OTEL_MONITORING TO otel_monitoring_user;
```

## Configuration

> :information_source: This receiver is in beta and configuration fields are subject to change.

The following settings are required:

- `endpoint` (default: `localhost:33015`): The hostname/IP address and port of the SAP HANA instance
- `username`
- `password`

The following settings are optional:

- `collection_interval` (default = `60s`): This receiver runs on an interval.
Each time it runs, it queries memcached, creates metrics, and sends them to the
next consumer. The `collection_interval` configuration option tells this
receiver the duration between runs. This value must be a string readable by
Golang's `ParseDuration` function (example: `1h30m`). Valid time units are
`ns`, `us` (or `Âµs`), `ms`, `s`, `m`, `h`.
- `initial_delay` (default = `1s`): defines how long this receiver waits before starting.
- `tls`:
  - `insecure` (default = true): whether to disable client transport security for the exporter's connection.
  - `ca_file`: path to the CA cert. For a client this verifies the server certificate. Should only be used if `insecure` is set to false.
  - `cert_file`: path to the TLS cert to use for TLS required connections. Should only be used if `insecure` is set to false.
  - `key_file`: path to the TLS key to use for TLS required connections. Should only be used if `insecure` is set to false.

Example:

```yaml
receivers:
  saphana:
    endpoint: "localhost:33015"
    collection_interval: 60s
    metrics:
      saphana.cpu.used:
        enabled: false
```

The full list of settings exposed for this receiver are documented [here](./config.go)
with detailed sample configurations [here](./testdata/config.yaml).

## Metrics

Details about the metrics produced by this receiver can be found in [metadata.yaml](./metadata.yaml). Further details of the monitoring queries used to collect them may be found in [queries.go](./queries.go).

> If all of the metrics collected by a given monitoring query are marked as `enabled: false` in the receiver configration, the monitoring query will not be executed.
