This receiver fetches metrics from a vCenter or ESXi host running VMware vSphere APIs.

## Prerequisites

This receiver has been built to support ESXi and vCenter versions:

- 8
- 7.0

A “Read Only” user assigned to a vSphere with permissions to the vCenter server, cluster and all subsequent resources being monitored must be specified in order for the receiver to retrieve information about them.

## Configuration


| Parameter           | Default | Type             | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------------- | ------- | ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| endpoint            |         | String           | Endpoint to the vCenter Server or ESXi host that has the sdk path enabled. Required. The expected format is `<protocol>://<hostname>` <br><br> i.e: `https://vcsa.hostname.localnet`                                                            |
| username            |         | String           | Required                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| password            |         | String           | Required                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| tls                 |         | TLSClientSetting | Not Required. Will use defaults for [configtls.ClientConfig](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/main/config/configtls/README.md). By default insecure settings are rejected and certificate verification is on. |
| collection_interval | 2m      | Duration         | This receiver collects metrics on an interval. If the vCenter is fairly large, this value may need to be increased. Valid time units are `ns`, `us` (or `µs`), `ms`, `s`, `m`, `h`                                                              |
| initial_delay       | 1s      | Duration         | Defines how long this receiver waits before starting.                                                                                                                                                                                           |

### Example Configuration

```yaml
receivers:
  vcenter:
    endpoint: http://localhost:15672
    username: otelu
    password: ${env:VCENTER_PASSWORD}
    collection_interval: 5m
    initial_delay: 1s
    metrics: []
```

The full list of settings exposed for this receiver are documented [here](./config.go) with detailed sample configurations [here](./testdata/config.yaml). TLS config is documented further under the [opentelemetry collector's configtls package](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/main/config/configtls/README.md).

## Metrics

Details about the metrics produced by this receiver can be found in [metadata.yaml](./metadata.yaml) with further documentation in [documentation.md](./documentation.md)

### Feature gates

**ALPHA**: `receiver.vcenter.resourcePoolMemoryUsageAttribute`

The feature gate `receiver.vcenter.resourcePoolMemoryUsageAttribute` once enabled will enable the memory usage type attribute for 
the `vcenter.resource_pool.memory.usage` metric.

This feature gate will eventually be enabled by default, and eventually the old implementation will be removed. It aims
to give users time to migrate to the new implementation. The target release for this featuregate to be enabled by default
is v0.107.0.
