This receiver supports opening a Unix Named Pipe (aka FIFO), and reading logs from it.

## Prerequisites

Named pipes are only supported on Unix operating systems.


## Configuration

The following settings are required:

- `path`: The path to open the named pipe at.

The following settings are optional:

- `mode`: The mode bits to set on the opened pipe (default: 666)

## Example Configuration

```yaml
receivers:
  namedpipe:
    path: /tmp/pipe
    mode: 0600
```
