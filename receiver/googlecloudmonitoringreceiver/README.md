The primary objective of the Google Cloud Monitoring Receiver is to gather time series metrics data from all Google services and convert this data into a pipeline format that facilitates further use.

This receiver gets GCP (Google Clout Platform) metrics from [GCP Monitoring REST API] via the [Google SDK for GCP Metrics] and then convert those timeseries data into OTel Format [Pipeline Data].

[GCP Monitoring REST API]: https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/ref_v3/rest/v3/projects.timeSeries/list
[Google SDK for GCP Metrics]: https://pkg.go.dev/cloud.google.com/go/monitoring/apiv3
[Pipeline Data]: https://pkg.go.dev/go.opentelemetry.io/collector/pdata

## Configuration
The following configuration options are supported:

```yaml
receivers:
  googlecloudmonitoring:
    collection_interval: 120s
    region: us-central1
    project_id: my-project-id
    service_account_key: "path/to/service_account.json"
    services:
      - service_name: "compute"
        metric_name: "compute.googleapis.com/instance/cpu/usage_time"
        delay: 60s
      - service_name: "connectors"
        metric_name: "connectors.googleapis.com/flex/instance/cpu/usage_time"
        delay: 60s
```

- `collection_interval` (Optional): The interval at which metrics are collected. Default is 60s.
- `region` (Required): The GCP region where the services are located.
- `project_id` (Required): The GCP project ID.
- `service_account_key` (Required): The path to the service account key JSON file.
- `services` (Required): A list of services to monitor.

Each service can have the following configuration:

- `service_name` (Required): The name of the GCP service (e.g., `compute`).
- `delay` (Optional): The delay before starting the collection of metrics for this service. Default is 0s.
- `metric_name` (Optional): The specific metric name to collect. If not set, all metrics are collected.

### Filtering

**Metrics Parameters** :

- A monitoring filter that specifies which time series should be returned. The filter must specify a single metric type. For example: `metric_name: "compute.googleapis.com/instance/cpu/usage_time"`
