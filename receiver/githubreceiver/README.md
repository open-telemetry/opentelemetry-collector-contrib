## Overview

The GitHub receiver receives data from [GitHub](https://github.com) via two methods:

1. Scrapes [version control system][vcsm] metrics from GitHub repositories and
organizations using the GraphQL and REST APIs.
2. Receives GitHub Actions events by serving a webhook endpoint, converting
those events into traces.

## Metrics - Getting Started

The current default set of metrics can be found in
[documentation.md](./documentation.md).

These metrics can be used as leading indicators ([capabilities][doracap])
to the [DORA][dorafour] metrics; helping provide insight into modern-day
engineering practices.

The collection interval is common to all scrapers and is set to 30 seconds by default.

> Note: Generally speaking, if the vendor allows for anonymous API calls, then you
> won't have to configure any authentication, but you may only see public repositories
> and organizations. You may also run into significantly more rate limiting.

```yaml
github:
    collection_interval: <duration> #default = 30s recommended 300s
    scrapers:
        scraper/config-1:
        scraper/config-2:
        ...
```

A more complete example using the GitHub scrapers with authentication is as follows:

```yaml
extensions:
    bearertokenauth/github:
        token: ${env:GH_PAT}

receivers:
    github:
        initial_delay: 1s
        collection_interval: 60s
        scrapers:
            scraper:
                metrics:
                    vcs.repository.contributor.count:
                        enabled: true
                github_org: myfancyorg
                search_query: "org:myfancyorg topic:o11yalltheway" #Recommended optional query override, defaults to "{org,user}:<github_org>"
                endpoint: "https://selfmanagedenterpriseserver.com"
                auth:
                    authenticator: bearertokenauth/github
service:
    extensions: [bearertokenauth/github]
    pipelines:
        metrics:
            receivers: [..., github]
            processors: []
            exporters: [...]
```

A [Grafana Dashboard for metrics from this receiver is on the marketplace](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/20976-engineering-effectiveness-metrics/).

### Scraping

> Important:
> * The GitHub scraper does not emit metrics for branches that have not had
>   changes since creation from the default branch (trunk).
> * Due to GitHub API limitations, it is possible for the branch time metric to
>   change when rebases occur, recreating the commits with new timestamps.

For additional context on GitHub scraper limitations and inner workings please
see the [Scraping README][ghsread].

## Traces - Getting Started

Workflow tracing support is actively being added to the GitHub receiver.
This is accomplished through the processing of GitHub Actions webhook
events for workflows and jobs. The [`workflow_job`][wjob] and
[`workflow_run`][wrun] event payloads are then constructed into `trace`
telemetry.

Each GitHub Action workflow or job, along with its steps, are converted
into trace spans, allowing the observation of workflow execution times,
success, and failure rates.

### Receiver Configuration

**IMPORTANT** - Ensure your WebHook endpoint is secured with a secret and a Web
Application Firewall (WAF) or other security measure.

The WebHook configuration exposes the following settings:

* `endpoint`: (default = `localhost:8080`) - The address and port to bind the WebHook to.
* `path`: (default = `/events`) - The path for Action events to be sent to.
* `health_path`: (default = `/health`) - The path for health checks.
* `secret`: (optional) - The secret used to [validates the payload][valid].
* `required_header`: (optional) - The required header key and value for incoming requests.
* `service_name`: (optional) - The service name for the traces. See the
[Configuring Service Name](#configuring-service-name) section for more
information.

The WebHook configuration block also accepts all the [confighttp][cfghttp]
settings.

An example configuration is as follows:

```yaml
receivers:
    github:
        webhook:
            endpoint: localhost:19418
            path: /events
            health_path: /health
            secret: ${env:SECRET_STRING_VAR}
            required_headers:
                WAF-Header: "value"
```

For tracing, all configuration is set under the `webhook` key. The full set
of exposed configuration values can be found in [`config.go`](./config.go).

### Configuring Service Name

The `service_name` option in the WebHook configuration can be used to set a
pre-defined `service.name` resource attribute for all traces emitted by the
receiver. This takes priority over the internal generation of the
`service.name`. In this configuration, it would be important to create a GitHub
receiver per GitHub app configured for the set of repositories that match your
`service.name`.

However, a more efficient approach would be to leverage the default generation
of `service.name` by configuring [Custom Properties][cp] in each GitHub
repository. To do that simply add a `service_name` key with the desired value in
each repository and all events sent to the GitHub receiver will properly
associate with that `service.name`. Alternatively, the `service_name` will be
derived from the repository name.

The precedence for setting the `service.name` resource attribute is as follows:

1. `service_name` configuration in the WebHook configuration.
2. `service_name` key in the repository's Custom Properties per repository.
3. `service_name` derived from the repository name.
4. `service.name` set to `unknown_service` per the semantic conventions as a fall back.

### Configuring A GitHub App

To configure a GitHub App, you will need to create a new GitHub App within your
organization. Refer to the general [GitHub App documentation][ghapp] for how to
create a GitHub App. During the subscription phase, subscribe to `workflow_run` and `workflow_job` events.

> NOTE: Only `workflow_run` events are supported in created traces at this time.
